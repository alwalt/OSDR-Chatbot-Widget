OSD-1,Expression data from drosophila melanogaster,Drosophila melanogaster,Spaceflight Study,"Space travel presents unlimited opportunities for exploration and discovery, but requires a more complete understanding of the immunological consequences of long-term exposure to the conditions of spaceflight. To understand these consequences better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model to compare innate immune responses to bacteria and fungi in flies that were either raised on earth or in outer space aboard the NASA Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-121). Microarrays were used to characterize changes in gene expression that occur in response to infection by bacteria and fungus in drosophila that were either hatched and raised in outer space (microgravity) or on earth (normal gravity). Whole Oregon R strain drosophila melanogaster fruit flies either raised on earth or in space that were (1) uninfected, (2) infected with bacteria (Escherichia coli), or (3) infected with fungus (Beauveria bassiana) were used for RNA extraction and hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays.","Spaceflight

OSD-3,Drosophila melanogaster gene expression changes after spaceflight.,Drosophila melanogaster,Spaceflight Study,"Gene expression levels were determined in 3rd instar and adult Drosophila melanogaster reared during spaceflight, to elucidate the genetic and molecular mechanisms underpinning the effects of microgravity on the immune system. The goal was to validate the Drosophila model for understanding alterations of innate immune responses in humans due to spaceflight. Five containers of flies, with ten female and five male fruit flies in each container, were housed and bred on the space shuttle (average orbit altitude of 330.35 km) for 12 days and 18.5 hours, with a new generation reared in microgravity. RNA was extracted on the day of shuttle landing from whole body animals (3rd instar larvae and adults), hybridized to Drosophila 2.0 Affymetrix genome arrays, and the expression level of all genes was normalized against the gene expression level from the corresponding developmental stage animals raised on ground. Spaceflight altered the expression of larval genes involved in the maturation of plasmatocytes (macrophages) and their phagocytic response, as well as the level of constitutive expression of pattern recognition receptors and opsonins that specifically recognize bacteria, and of lysozymes, antimicrobial peptide pathway and immune stress genes, hallmarks of humoral immunity. Larval microarrays (FL 6 samples) are based on RNA extracted from 6 independent sets of 50 mid 3rd instar larvae reared in microgravity and collected on the day of landing after 12 days and 18.5 hours on the space shuttle and the same number of control larvae raised on ground (GL 6 samples). Adults microarrays (F1 3 samples) are based on RNA from 3 sets of 20 adult females each, that emerged during spaceflight and within 4 hours of landing and the same number of adult females from the corresponding ground control containers (G1 3 samples).","Developmental Stage

OSD-4,Microarray Analysis of Space-flown Murine Thymus Tissue,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Microarray Analysis of Space-flown Murine Thymus Tissue Reveals Changes in Gene Expression Regulating Stress and Glucocorticoid Receptors. We used microarrays to detail the gene expression of space-flown thymic tissue and identified distinct classes of up-regulated genes during this process. We report here microarray gene expression analysis in young adult C57BL/6NTac mice at 8 weeks of age after exposure to spaceflight aboard the space shuttle (STS-118) for a period of 13 days. Upon conclusion of the mission, thymus lobes were extracted from space flown mice (FLT) as well as age- and sex-matched ground control mice similarly housed in animal enclosure modules (AEM). mRNA was extracted and an automated array analysis for gene expression was performed. Examination of the microarray data revealed 970 individual probes that had a 1.5 fold or greater change. When these data were averaged (n equals 4), we identified 12 genes that were significantly up- or down-regulated by at least 1.5 fold after spaceflight (p less than 0.05). Together, these data demonstrate that spaceflight induces significant changes in the thymic mRNA expression of genes that regulate stress, glucocorticoid receptor metabolism, and T cell signaling activity. These data explain, in part, the reported systemic compromise of the immune system after exposure to the microgravity of space.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,STS-118,Animal Enclosure Module (AEM),10.25966/qq9p-pc28

Two approaches were used; GFP reporter genes were used to collect gene expression data in real time within unique GFP imaging hardware, and plants were harvested on orbit to RNAlater for subsequent analyses of gene expression with using Affymetrix and SAGE transcriptome analyses. Three tissue types were examined (leaves, hypocotyls and roots) and compared to analyses conducted with whole plants. Transcriptome analyses with whole plants suggested that the spaceflight environment had little impact on the transcriptome of arabidopsis, however, closer examination of selected tissues revealed that there are a number of tissue-specific responses that arabidopsis employs to respond to this novel environment","Spaceflight

OSD-8,Gravitational and magnetic field variations synergize to cause subtle variations in the global transcriptional state of Arabidopsis in vitro callus cultures,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Using diamagnetic levitation, we have exposed A. thaliana in vitro callus cultures to five environments with different levels of effective gravity (from levitation i.e. simulated mg* to 2g*) and magnetic fields (10.1 to 16.5 Tesla) and we have compared the results with those of similar experiments done in a Random Position Machine (simulated micro g) and a Large Diameter Centrifuge (2g) free of high magnetic fields. Microarray analysis indicates that there are changes in overall gene expression of the cultured cells exposed to these unusual environments but also that gravitational and magnetic field produce synergic variations in the steady state of the transcriptional profile of A. thaliana. Significant changes in the expression of structural, abiotic stress and secondary metabolism genes were observed into the magnet field. These results confirm that the strong magnetic field, both at micro g* or 2g*, has a significant effect on the expression of these genes but subtle gravitational effects are still observable. These subtle responses to microgravity environments are opposite to the ones observed in a hypergravity one.","Treatment

OSD-11,Space flight alters bacterial gene expression and virulence and reveals a role for global regulator Hfq,Salmonella enterica,Spaceflight Study,"A comprehensive analysis of both the molecular genetic and phenotypic responses of any organism to the space flight environment has never been accomplished because of significant technological and logistical hurdles. Moreover, the effects of space flight on microbial pathogenicity and associated infectious disease risks have not been studied. The bacterial pathogen Salmonella typhimurium was grown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-115 and compared with identical ground control cultures. Global microarray and proteomic analyses revealed that 167 transcripts and 73 proteins changed expression with the conserved RNA-binding protein Hfq identified as a likely global regulator involved in the response to this environment. Hfq involvement was confirmed with a ground-based microgravity culture model. Space flight samples exhibited enhanced virulence in a murine infection model and extracellular matrix accumulation consistent with a biofilm. Strategies to target Hfq and related regulators could potentially decrease infectious disease risks during space flight missions and provide novel therapeutic options on Earth.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,STS-115,"Group Activation Pack (GAP), Multiple Orbital Bioreactor with Instrumentation and Automated Sampling (MOBIAS)",10.25966/7mzk-an69

We determined ,changes in the yeast model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisisae, when grown in LSMMG using the rotating High ,Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV). A significant number of genes were up- or down-regulated by at least two fold in cells ,that were grown for 5 generations or 25 generations in HARVs. We identified genes in cell wall integrity signaling ,pathways containing MAP kinase cascades that may provide clues to novel physiological responses of eukaryotic ,cells to the external stress of a low-shear modeled microgravity environment. A comparison of the microgravity ,response to other environmental stress response (ESR) genes showed that 26% of the genes that respond ,significantly to LSMMG are involved in a general environmental stress response, while 74% of the genes may ,represent a unique transcriptional response to microgravity. In addition, we found changes in genes involved in ,budding, cell polarity establishment, and cell separation that confirm our hypothesis that exposure to LSMMG ,causes changes in gene transcription resulting in a phenotypic response. The results of the study provide interesting ,clues to potential mechanisms involved in the response to, adaptation to, and survival of eukaryotic cells in a ,microgravity environment and our findings may have important health implications for human spaceflight.

OSD-13,T Cell Activation in Microgravity Compared to 1g (Earth's) Gravity,Homo sapiens,Spaceflight Study,"This study tested the hypothesis that transcription of immediate early genes is inhibited in T cells activated in microgravity (uG). Immunosuppression during spaceflight is a major barrier to safe long-term human space habitation and travel. The goals of these experiments were to prove that uG was the cause of impaired T cell activation during spaceflight as well as understand the mechanisms controlling early T cell activation. T cells from 4 human donors were stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) and anti-CD28 onboard the International Space Station (ISS). An onboard centrifuge was used to generate a 1g simultaneous control to isolate the effects of uG from other variables of spaceflight. Microarray expression analysis after 1.5 hours of activation demonstrated that mg- and 1g-activated T cells had distinct patterns of global gene expression and identified 47 genes that were significantly differentially down-regulated in uG. Importantly, several key immediate early genes were inhibited in uG. T cells were isolated from human volunteers. T cells from each donor were kept separate and loaded into individual chambers in separate cassettes for the following treatments: uG non-activated, uG activated, and 1g activated. Therefore, samples represent biological triplicates. Experimental units were launched into space and placed into the KUBIK facility onboard the International Space Station. The 1g units were placed in the central centrifuge positions and centrifuged with an applied 1g force. The uG units were place in the static positions for continued uG exposure. After 30 minutes of pre-incubation, uG non-activated units were fixed by addition of RNALater (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA), removed from the incubator, and stored in 4¬∞C. The uG and 1g activated units were injected with final concentration 10mg/ml Con A and 4mg/ml anti-CD28. These cassettes were replaced into KUBIK on either the centrifuge or static positions and activated for 1.5 hours. Activation was stopped with the addition of RNALater and the units were then moved to 4¬∞C storage. All units were returned to Earth for analysis.","Treatment

OSD-14,Response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to low shear modeled microgravity,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Ground Study,"Anticipating the risk for infectious disease during space exploration and habitation is a critical factor to ensure safety, health and performance of the crewmembers. As a ubiquitous environmental organism that is occasionally part of the human flora, Pseudomonas aeruginosa could pose a health hazard for the immuno-compromised astronauts. In order to gain insights in the behavior of P. aeruginosa in spaceflight conditions, two spaceflight-analogue culture systems, i.e. the rotating wall vessel (RWV) and the random position machine (RPM), were used. Microarray analysis of P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in the low shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) environment of the RWV compared to the normal gravity control (NG), revealed a regulatory role for AlgU (RpoE). Specifically, P. aeruginosa cultured in LSMMG exhibited increased alginate production and up-regulation of AlgU-controlled transcripts, including those encoding stress-related proteins. This study also shows the involvement of Hfq in the LSMMG response, consistent with its previously identified role in the Salmonella LSMMG- and spaceflight response. Furthermore, cultivation in LSMMG increased heat and oxidative stress resistance and caused a decrease in the culture oxygen transfer rate. Interestingly, the global transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa grown in the RPM was similar to that in NG. The possible role of differences in fluid mixing between the RWV and RPM is discussed, with the overall collective data favoring the RWV as the optimal model to study the LSMMG-response of suspended cells. This study represents a first step towards the identification of specific virulence mechanisms of P. aeruginosa activated in response to spaceflight-analogue conditions, and could direct future research regarding the risk assessment and prevention of Pseudomonas infections for the crew in flight and the general public.",Microgravity Simulation,transcription profiling,,,10.25966/950f-7258
OSD-15,Transcriptional and proteomic response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 to spaceflight conditions involves Hfq regulation and reveals a role for oxygen,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Spaceflight Study,"This study describes the transcriptional response of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to low-Earth orbit environmental conditions. Our aim was to assess whether the microgravity environment of spaceflight could induce virulence traits in P. aeruginosa. To this end, P. aeruginosa cultures were grown in space, and the expression profile was compared with ground control samples (both in biological triplicate). Characterization of bacterial behavior in the microgravity environment of spaceflight is of importance towards risk assessment and prevention of infectious disease during long-term missions. Further, this research field unveils new insights into connections between low fluid-shear regions encountered by pathogens during their natural infection process in vivo, and bacterial virulence. This study is the first to characterize the global transcriptomic and proteomic response of an opportunistic pathogen that is actually found in the space habitat, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Overall, P. aeruginosa responded to spaceflight conditions through differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins, with Hfq identified as a global transcriptional regulator in the response to this environment. Since Hfq was also induced in spaceflight-grown Salmonella typhimurium, Hfq represents the first spaceflight-induced regulator across the bacterial species border. The major P. aeruginosa virulence-related genes induced in spaceflight conditions were the lecA and lecB lectins and the rhamnosyltransferase (rhlA), involved in the production of rhamnolipids. The transcriptional response of spaceflight-grown P. aeruginosa was compared with our previous data of this organism grown in microgravity-analogue conditions using the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor technology. Interesting similarities were observed, among others with regard to Hfq regulation and oxygen utilization. While LSMMG-grown P. aeruginosa mainly induced genes involved in microaerophilic metabolism, P. aeruginosa cultured in spaceflight adopted an anaerobic mode of growth, in which denitrification was presumably most prominent. Differences in hardware between spaceflight and LSMMG experiments, in combination with more pronounced low fluid shear and mixing in spaceflight when compared to LSMMG conditions, were hypothesized to be at the origin of these observations. Collectively, our data suggest that spaceflight conditions could induce the transition of P. aeruginosa from an opportunistic organism to potential pathogen, results that are of importance for infectious disease risk assessment and prevention, both during spaceflight missions and in the clinic.","Spaceflight

OSD-17,Transcription profiling by array of the response of Arabidopsis cultivar Columbia etiolated seedlings and undifferentiated tissue culture cells to the spaceflight environment,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"We address a key baseline question of whether gene expression changes are induced by the orbital environment, and then we ask whether undifferentiated cells, cells presumably lacking the typical gravity response mechanisms, perceive spaceflight. Arabidopsis seedlings and undifferentiated cultured Arabidopsis cells were launched in April, 2010, as part of the BRIC-16 flight experiment on STS-131. Biologically replicated DNA microarray and averaged RNA digital transcript profiling revealed several hundred genes in seedlings and cell cultures that were significantly affected by launch and spaceflight. The response was moderate in seedlings; only a few genes were induced by more than 7-fold, and the overall intrinsic expression level for most differentially expressed genes was low. In contrast, cell cultures displayed a more dramatic response, with dozens of genes showing this level of differential expression, a list comprised primarily of heat shock-related and stress-related genes. This baseline transcriptome profiling of seedlings and cultured cells confirms the fundamental hypothesis that survival of the spaceflight environment requires adaptive changes that are both governed and displayed by alterations in gene expression. The comparison of intact plants with cultures of undifferentiated cells confirms a second hypothesis: undifferentiated cells can detect spaceflight in the absence of specialized tissue or organized developmental structures known to detect gravity.","Spaceflight

OSD-18,Microarray Profile of Gene Expression during Osteoclast Differentiation in Modeled Microgravity,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Microgravity leads to a 10-15% loss of bone mass in astronauts during space flight. Osteoclast is the multinucleated bone resorbing cell. In this study, we used NASA developed ground based Rotary Wall Vessel Bioreactor (RWV), Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) to simulate microgravity (uXg) conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to ground based control (Xg) mouse bone marrow cultures. We further determined the gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 osteoclast progenitor cells in microgravity by agilent microarray analysis. Gene expression pattern was functional group clustered by transcriptome analysis using gene ontology tree machine (GOTM) for cell proliferation/survival, differentiation and function. We confirm the microgravity modulated gene expression critical for osteoclast differentiation by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis in murine bone marrow cultures. We identify transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, PU-1 critical for osteoclast differentiation is up-regulated in microgravity conditions. In addition, microgravity resulted in 2.3 and 2.0-fold increase in the level of cathepsin K and MMP-9 matrix metalloproteinase expression in preosteoclast cells involved in the bone resorption process respectively. We also demonstrate a significant increase in the expression levels of M-CSF receptor, c-Fms and PLCy2 and S100A8 molecules that play an important role in Ca2+ signaling essential for osteoclast function. Further, microgravity stimulated preosteoclast cells showed elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared to ground based control cells. Thus, microgravity regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights in to molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of osteoclast differentiation/activation responsible for bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight mission. Microgravity associated with space flight is a challenge for normal bone homeostasis. Astronauts experience 10-15% bone loss during a space flight mission. We aimed to determine the effect of simulated microgravity on osteoclast preosteoclasts cells. RAW264.7 cells (1.5 x 106 /ml) were loaded in RCCS with DMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL (80ng/ml) for 24 h to obtain preosteoclasts in parallel with ground based control cells. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol reagent (Biotecx Labs, Houston, TX) from control (Xg) and microgravity (uXg) subjected cells and hybridized with Agilent whole mouse genome 4x44K array system. Slides were washed and scanned on an Agilent G2565 microarray scanner. Data obtained were analyzed with Agilent feature extraction and GeneSpring GX v7.3.1 software packages (Genus biosystem, Inc.

OSD-19,Transcription profiling of rat to study the effect of hindlimb unloading on healing of medial collateral ligaments 3 weeks after injury,Rattus norvegicus,Ground Study,"A recent physiological study established that hindlimb unloading of rats at 3 and 7 weeks inhibits healing of injured ligaments, resulting in a badly aligned, discontinuous collagen matrix. Using tissue from these rats, we focused on the 3-week time point employing microarray analysis to identify what cellular processes or lack of processes could account for these observed deficiencies. We used the Affymetrix RG_U34A GeneChip and performed image analysis with Microarray Suite 5.0. For normalization we used the MAS global normalization protocol with a default target mean signal of 500. Gene expression in medial collateral ligament tissue under 4 different treatment conditions was measured: loaded control, loaded wound healing, unloaded control, and unloaded wound healing. From our results, it appears that unloaded tissue lags behind loaded tissue in its progression through the healing process and at 3 weeks is still engaged in the proliferative phase, whereas loaded tissue is actively remodeling its collagen matrix.","Hindlimb Unloading

OSD-20,Candida albicans response to spaceflight (NASA STS-115),Candida albicans,Spaceflight,"This study presents the first global transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization of the major human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, grown in spaceflight conditions. Microarray analysis revealed that C. albicans subjected to short-term spaceflight culture differentially regulated 454 genes compared to synchronous ground controls, which represented 8.4% of the analyzed ORFs. Spaceflight-cultured C. albicans induced genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation), which was validated by microscopic and flow cytometry analysis. We also observed enhanced random budding of spaceflight-cultured cells as opposed to more normal bipolar budding patterns for ground samples, in accordance with the gene expression data. Furthermore, genes involved in antifungal agent and stress resistance were differentially regulated in spaceflight, including induction of ABC transporters and members of the major facilitator family, downregulation of ergosterol-encoding genes, and upregulation of genes involved in oxidative stress resistance. Finally, downregulation of genes involved in the actin cytoskeleton was observed. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulator Cap1 and over 30% of the Cap1 regulon was differentially expressed in spaceflight-cultured C. albicans. A potential role for Cap1 in the spaceflight response of C. albicans is suggested, as this regulator is involved in random budding, cell aggregation, actin cytoskeleton, and oxidative stress resistance; all related to observed spaceflight-associated changes of C. albicans. While culture of C. albicans in microgravity potentiates a global change in gene expression that could induce a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence in a murine intraperitoneal (i.p.) infection model was observed. This study represents an important basis for the assessment of the risk that commensal flora could play during spaceflight missions. Furthermore, since the low fluid-shear environment of microgravity is relevant to physical forces encountered by pathogens during the infection process, insights gained from this study could identify novel infectious disease mechanisms, with downstream benefits for the general public. Cells were grown for 24 hours on the space shuttle or as ground-based controls, preserved in RNALater, and stored at -80C. Four samples of each flight- and ground-based controls were harvested for microarray analysis. GAP is Group Activation Pack and each GAP contains 8 FPAs. The numbers represent the # assigned to the particular GAP and the number assigned to the specific FPA (1-8) within the indicated GAP.

OSD-28,"Bacillus subtilis spores, PROTECT experiment, Space-exposed and Mars-exposed vs. Earth-control",Bacillus subtilis,Spaceflight Study,"Because of their ubiquity and resistance to spacecraft decontamination, bacterial spores are considered likely potential forward contaminants on robotic missions to Mars. Thus it is important to understand their global responses to long-term exposure to space or Mars environments. As part of the PROTECT experiment, spores of B. subtilis 168 were exposed to real space conditions and to simulated martian conditions for 559 days in low Earth orbit mounted on the EXPOSE-E exposure platform outside the European Columbus module on the International Space Station. Upon return, spores were germinated, total RNA extracted and fluorescently labeled, and used to probe a custom Bacillus subtilis microarray to identify genes preferentially activated or repressed relative to ground control spores. Increased transcript levels were detected for a number of stress-related regulons responding to DNA damage (SOS response, SP-beta prophage induction), protein damage (CtsR/Clp system), oxidative stress (PerR regulon) and cell envelope stress (SigV regulon). Spores exposed to space demonstrated a much broader and more severe stress response than spores exposed to simulated Mars conditions. The results are discussed in the context of planetary protection for a hypothetical journey of potential forward contaminant spores from Earth to Mars and their subsequent residence on Mars.

OSD-29,Genechip analysis of bone marrow osteoprogenitors exposed to microgravity,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"In March 2006, murine Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) were flown in the Soyuz 12S to the International Space Station to investigate the effects of microgravity on their osteogenic potential in a three-dimensional environment. BMSC were grown in porous bioceramic Skelite disks (dia 9 mm x T 1.2 mm). The constructs were exposed to microgravity for ca. 8 days, then fixed for RNA extraction. While the flight experiment was performed in fully automated hardware inside the KUBIK incubator, one group of control samples were incubated inside manually operated hardwares (flight control), and the other control group was incubated under routine laboratory conditions (lab control). The altered gene expression profile was analyzed by Mouse Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix) representing whole-transcript coverage. Each one of the 28853 genes is represented on the array by approximately 26 probes spread across the full length of the gene, providing a more complete and more accurate picture of gene expression than the 3' based expression array design. A few days of microgravity were sufficient to determinate, at least at the molecular level, an effect in the BMSC; this response expressed a stress condition able to determinate consequences on several compartments and cellular functions. In particular, it seems to promote a gene expression, known to be associated with neurogenic activity (e.g. axon guidance), perhaps promoting the BMSC capability to be committed in that direction. The osteo-induction, by dexamethasone-based medium, due to the short duration of stimulation, did not have the possibility to manifest itself at the phenotypic level but only partially at the molecular level.","Spaceflight

OSD-32,Effect of microgravity on brain gene expression in mice,,Ground Study,"Changes in gravitational force such as that experienced by astronauts during space flight induce a redistribution of fluids from the caudad to the cephalad portion of the body together with an elimination of normal head-to-foot hydrostatic pressure gradients. To assess brain gene profile changes associated with microgravity and fluid shift, a large-scale analysis of mRNA expression levels was performed in the brains of 2 weeks control and hindlimb-unloaded (HU) mice using cDNA microarrays. Although to different extent, all functional categories displayed significantly regulated genes indicating that considerable transcriptomic alterations are induced by HU. Interestingly, the TIC class (transport of small molecules and ions into the cells) had the highest percentage of up-regulated genes, while the most down-regulated genes were those of the JAE class (Cell junction, Adhesion, Extracellular Matrix). TIC genes comprised 16% of those whose expression was altered, including sodium channel, nonvoltage-gated 1 beta (Scnn1b), glutamate receptor (Grin1), voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (Vdac1), calcium channel beta 3 subunit (Cacnb3) and others. The analysis performed by GeneMAPP revealed several altered protein classes and functional pathways such as blood coagulation and immune response, learning and memory, ion channels and cell junction. In particular, data indicate that HU causes an alteration in hemostasis which resolves in a shift toward a more hyper-coagulative state with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Furthermore, HU treatment seems to impact on key steps of synaptic plasticity and learning processes. We used brains of four control (C1, C2, C3, C4) and four tail-suspended hindlimb-unloaded (E1, E2, E3, E4) mice to ensure statistical relevance of the study. 60 ug of total RNA extracted in TRIzol from each brain was reversed transcribed into labeled cDNAs using fluorescent Cy5 or Cy3-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, NJ). Differently labeled cDNAs obtained from a pair of biological replicas were co-hybridized overnight at 50C with a microscope slide spotted with ~ 27,000 mouse cDNA sequences produced by the Microarray Core Facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the ÔøΩmultiple yellowÔøΩ design (i.e.: C1C2, C3C4, E1E2, E3E4), described in Iacobas DA, Fan C, Iacobas S et al., Transcriptomic changes in developing kidney exposed to chronic hypoxia.

Wild type mice (n=3) were launched by Space Shuttle Discovery and housed on the International Space Station (ISS) for 91 days. They returned to the Earth by Space Shuttle Atlantis. But only one mouse returned to the Earth alive. Whole brain was sampled from the mouse killed by inhalation of carbon dioxide at the Life Sciences Support Facility of Kennedy Space Center within 3-4 hours after landing. After the spaceflight experiment, the on-ground experiment was also carried out at the Advanced Biotechnology Center in Genova, Italy. A mouse with the same species, sex, and age was housed in mice drawer system (MDS), which was utilized for the spaceflight (SF) mice, for 3 months as the ground control (GC). Another mouse was housed in normal vivarium cage as the laboratory control (LC). Amount of food and water supplementation and environmental conditions were simulated as the flight group. After 3 months, brain was sampled from one mouse in group GC and LC, respectively. Comprehensive analyses of gene expression were performed in the right brain. Total of 4,000 genes were analyzed. The expression levels of 60 genes significantly changed in response to SF compared with LC and/or GC. The 15 and 16 genes were up- (> 2 folds) and down-regulated (< 0.5 folds), respectively, following SF vs. GC. The levels of 58 genes were significantly altered by housing in MDS in space and/or on the ground. Forty seven and 11 genes were significantly up- and down-regulated vs. LC. Twenty seven out of these genes responded to caging in MDS both in space and on the ground. Further, 31 genes were influenced by housing in MDS on the Earth.

OSD-34,Environmental and simulation facility conditions can modulate a behavioral-driven altered gravity response of Drosophila imagoes transcriptome,Drosophila melanogaster,Ground Study,"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling shows that reducing gravity levels in the International Space Station (ISS) causes important alterations in Drosophila gene expression. However, simulation experiments on ground, without space constraints, show weaker effects than space environment. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals a subtle response of the transcriptome using different populations and microgravity and hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that, in addition to behavioural responses that can be detected also at the gene expression level, the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. The alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have effects on gene expression that depends both on the environmental conditions and the ground based facility used to compensate the gravity vector. Alternative and commons effects of mechanical facilities, like the Random Positioning Machine and a centrifuge, and strong magnetic field ones, like a cryogenically cooled superconductive magnet, are discussed. We compare the effects over the gene expression profile of different gender/age Drosophila imagoes in 3-4 days-long experiments under altered gravity conditions into three GBF (Ground Based Facilities for micro/hyper- gravity simulation) using whole genome microarray platforms. Descriptions of different GBFs (treatments): LDC means Large Diameter Centrifuge. Samples can be placed under three conditions: inside LDC (at certain g level), at the LDC rotational control and at external 1g control (outside the LDC). RPM means Random Positioning Machine. Samples can be placed under two conditions: inside RPM (at nearly 0g, Microgravity level) and at external 1g control (outside the RPM). At the magnet, means INSIDE the Magnetic levitator (another GBF). Samples can be placed under four conditions: inside Magnet 0g* (at microgravity with magnetic field), inside Magnet at 1g* (internal control with magnetic field) or inside the magnet 2g* (at hypergravity with magnetic field) and at external 1g control (outside the magnet)","Age

OSD-37,Comparison of the spaceflight transcriptome of four commonly used Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"This experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptomes of four commonly used natural variants (ecotypes) of Arabidopsis thaliana using RNAseq. In nature, Arabidopsis is a native of Europe/Asia/Northwestern Africa and is found across the globe growing in a wide range of environments. The geographical spread of these various populations has led to a slow divergence leading to distinct ecotypes. Understanding the impact of this ecotypic variability is an important factor when using Arabidopsis as a model. Seeds of the ecotypes Col_0, Ler-2, Ws-2 and Cvi-0 were flown to the International Space Station as part of CRS-4 mission in the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware. The seeds were germinated on orbit, grown for 8 days and then fixed in RNAlater and frozen in the MELFI freezer for return to Earth. Once returned RNA was isolated and RNAseq performed to catalog the transcriptional patterns of the plants grown in space. An identical set of samples were grown in parallel on the ground to provide controls to allow assessment of transcriptional changes specifically associated with the spaceflight environment.

OSD-38,Proteomics and Transcriptomics analysis of Arabidopsis Seedlings in Microgravity,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"On Earth plants are constantly exposed to a gravitational field of 1G. Gravity affects a plant in every step of its development. Germinating seedlings orient their radicle and hypocotyl and growing plants position organs at a specific Gravitropic Set-point Angle dictated by the asymmetric distribution of auxin depending on the gravity vector. Hence gravitropism is one of the fundamental growth responses in plants. For any experiment studying the effects of gravity on plants, the ultimate control is the microgravity in space. In this study, Arabidopsis seeds were flown to the International Space Station and allowed to germinate and grow for 3 days in microgravity. Arabidopsis Wild Type Col-0 seeds were plated onto twenty-two 60mm Petri plates, loaded into PDFUs and inserted 4 Biological Research in Canisters (BRICs). Approximately 800 seeds were sterilized, plated on each 60mm Petri plates and cold stratified for 16 hours followed by 2 hours of white light treatment. The BRICs were maintained at 4C until spaceflight to ensure seed germination in microgravity. After 3 days of germination and growth, the seedlings were fixed by injecting RNAlater into the chamber. They were kept at ambient temperature for 12 hours followed by freezing at -80C. An additional 22 plates were used as ground controls. After the spaceflight, tissue from five plates was pooled to make each of three replicates. Both membrane and soluble proteins were extracted from the pooled seedlings.

OSD-46,Gamma radiation and HZE treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as collateral damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the DSB response were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing extended night. This response was not apparent in gamma-irradiated plants. We treated 5-day-old WT and atm-1 seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana with 100 Gy of Gamma radiation (over a span of 15 minutes) or 30 Gy of HZE (over a span of approximately 12 minutes). Gamma irradiations were completed at 8:40 am, while HZE irradiations were conducted in two runs (due to space limitations) which were completed at 1:09 and 1:28pm respectively. Gamma treated seedlings were sampled at 10:10 am, 11:40 am, 2:55 pm, 8:40 pm, and 8:40 am. HZE treated seedlings were sampled at 2:39 pm, 4:09 pm, 7:24 pm, 1:09 am, and 1:09 pm. Un-irradiated WT and atm-1 control seedlings were sampled at 10:45 am on Day #1 and 9:15 am on Day #2.

We found that there were significant differences in the number of macrophages that developed in space compared to controls maintained on Earth. We found that there were significant changes in the distribution of cells that expressed CD11b, CD31, F4/80, Mac2, Ly6C and c-Fos. However, there were no changes in c-Fms expression and no consistent pattern of advanced or retarded differentiation during space flight.

OSD-51,Woman skeletal muscle transcriptome with bed rest and countermeasures.,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Microgravity has a dramatic impact on human physiology, illustrated in particular with skeletal muscle impairment. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms leading to loss of muscle mass and structural disorders is necessary for the definition of efficient clinical and spaceflight countermeasures. We investigated the effects of long-term bed rest on transcriptome of soleus (SOL) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles in healthy women (BRC group, n=8), and the potential beneficial impact of protein supplementation (BRN group, n=8) and of a combined resistance and aerobic training (BRE group, n=8). Gene expression profiles were obtained using an in-house made microarray containing 6681 muscles-relevant genes. A two-class statistical analysis was applied on the 2103 genes with consolidated expression. We identified 472 and 207 modified genes, respectively for SOL and VL in BRC group. Further clustering approaches, identifying relevant biological mechanisms or pathways, underlined five main subclusters. Three are composed almost of upregulated genes involved mainly in nucleic acid and protein metabolism, and two composed almost of downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism. Exercise countermeasure demonstrated a drastic compensatory effect, decreasing the number of differentially-expressed genes by 89 and 96% in SOL and VL. In contrast, nutrition countermeasure had a moderate effect and decreased the number of differentially-expressed genes by 40 and 25% in SOL and VL. Our results allowed reporting a systematic, global and comprehensive view of long-term woman muscle atrophy and brought new lights and insights for space environment and for women who undergo a long-term clinical bed rest. Biological samples were collected from Pre- and Post- bed rest (BR) soleus and vastus lateralis biopsies of each subject from the three groups (bed rest only: BRC; Exercise: BRE; Nutrition: BRN). six technical replicate values (2 duplicate hybridizations a et b to chips with triplicate spots xxx) were obtained for each skeletal muscle sample.

Presumably, extraterrestrial infection may trigger potentially novel bionetworks different from the terrestrial equivalent, which could only be probed by investigating the host-pathogen relationship with minimum terrestrial bias.

Transcriptomic investigation revealed an immune blunting in microgravity; Lbp, MyD88 and MD-2 failed to encode proteins responsible for early LPS uptake. Longer exposure results implied that there was a delayed response, potentially ineffectual in preventing pathogens from opportunistically modulating the infection network. Lack of recruitment of growth factors and a debilitated apoptosome supported this potential explanation. Certain cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, surged in response to LPS insult in microgravity. Contrasting expressions of B2M, TIMP-1 and VEGRs suggested impaired pro-survival adaptation and healing mechanisms. The susceptibility of oxidative stress and immune regulation to microgravity compelled further investigation of the respective microRNA modulators such as miR-200a and miR-146b. These miRNAs were expressed differently in response to LPS assaults in different gravitational limits. In conclusion, despite a serious drawback attributed to the small sample size, we delineated some of the important aspects of the extraterrestrial etiology; more comprehensive follow up studies are warranted. Present study though compromised by the small sample size was able to shade lights on several aspects of immunological responses to the endotoxic assault mediated by uG. Implementing the host-pathogen interactions in the spaceflight and subsequently lysing the cells onboard presented the critical distinguishing features of the present study from the past reports. We identified the CCM of Tissue Genesis, Inc., HI as the suitable hardware system to carry out the experiment in the spaceflight. CCM is an automated, feedback controlled module that can concurrently support 24 bioreactors following protocols exclusively programmed for individual bioreactor. For this experiment we use samples EA41, EA 47, EA45, and EA155 that were exposed to LPS for 4 hours. Samples EA123, EA165, EA127, EA126 were exposed to LPS for 8Hrs. Samples EA33, EA 125, EA79 and EA 39 were controls in this experiment.","Treatment

OSD-55,microRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes cultured in modeled microgravity,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"In the present study we analyzed miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) incubated in microgravity condition, simulated by a ground-based Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor. Our results show that 42 miRNAs were differentially expressed in MMG-incubated PBLs compared with 1g-incubated ones. Among these, miR-9-5p, miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p, and miR-378-3p were the most dysregulated. To improve the detection of functional miRNA-mRNA pairs we performed gene expression profiles on the same samples assayed for miRNA profiling and we integrated miRNA and mRNA expression data. The functional classification of miRNA-correlated genes evidenced significant enrichments in the biological processes of immune/inflammatory response, signal transduction, regulation of response to stress, regulation of programmed cell death and regulation of cell proliferation. We identified the correlation between miR-9-3p, miR-155-5p, miR-150-3p and miR-378-3p expression with that of genes involved in immune/inflammatory response (eg. IFNG and IL17F), apoptosis (eg. PDCD4 and PTEN) and cell proliferation (eg. NKX3-1 and GADD45A). Experimental assays of cell viability and apoptosis induction validated the results obtained by bioinformatics analyses demonstrating that in human PBLs the exposure to reduced gravitational force increases the frequency of apoptosis and decreases cell proliferation. microRNA expression profiling were carried out on total RNA extracted from PBLs of twelve healthy donors at the end of 24h-incubation time in MMG and in 1g conditions. Analyses were performed by using the Human miRNA Microarray kit (V2) (Agilent Technologies), that allows the detection of 723 known human (miRBase v.10.1) and 76 human viral miRNAs. By comparing the expression profile of MMG-incubated vs. 1g-incubated PBLs of the same donor, we found 42 differentially expressed miRNAs, 25 up-regulated and 17 down-regulated.","Simulated Microgravity

However, the more subtle biological effects of spaceflight on cells and organisms are difficult to measure in a systematic, unbiased manner. Here we test the utility of the molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collection to provide a quantitative assessment of the effects of microgravity on a model organism. We developed robust hardware to screen, in parallel, the complete collection of ~4800 homozygous and ~5900 heterozygous (including ~1100 single-copy deletions of essential genes) yeast deletion strains, each carrying unique DNA that acts as strain identifiers. We compared strain fitness for the homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion collections grown in spaceflight and ground, as well as plus and minus hyperosmolar sodium chloride, providing a second additive stressor. The genome-wide sensitivity profiles obtained from these treatments were then queried for their similarity to a compendium of drugs whose effects on the yeast collection have been previously reported. We found that the effects of spaceflight have high concordance with the effects of DNA-damaging agents and changes in redox state, suggesting mechanisms by which spaceflight may negatively affect cell fitness.","culture media

OSD-59,RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of reactive oxygen species gene network in Mizuna plants grown in long-term space flight,Brassica rapa,Spaceflight Study,"Space environment is suspected to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce oxidative stress in plants, however, little is known about the gene expression of ROS gene network in plants grown in long-term space flight. RNA-Seq was used to define the large-scale gene expression profiles of Mizuna harvested after 27 days cultivation in the international space station to understand the molecular response and adaptation to space environment.Results: Total reads of transcripts from the Mizuna grown in the international space station as well as on the ground by RNA-Seq using next generation sequencing technology showed 8,258 and 14,170 transcripts up- and down-regulated in the space-grown Mizuna, respectively, when compared with those from the ground-grown Mizuna. A total of 20 in 32 ROS oxidative marker genes were up-regulated, including high expression of 4 hallmarks, and preferentially expressed gene associated with ROS-scavenging genes was thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, and alternative oxidase genes. In the transcription factors of ROS gene network , MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3, OXI1-MKK4-MPK3, and OXI1-MPK3 of MAP cascades, induction of WRKY22 by MEKK1-MKK4-MPK3 cascade, induction of WRKY25 and repression of ZAT7 by Zat12 were suggested. RbohD and RbohF genes were up-regulated preferentially in NADPH oxidase genes, which produce ROS.Conclusions: Our large-scale transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the space environment induced oxidative stress and ROS gene network was activated in the space-grown Mizuna, some of which were common genes up-regulated by abiotic and biotic stress and were preferentially up-regulated genes by the space environment, even though Mizuna grew in the space as well as on the ground, showing that plants could acclimate to the space environment by reprograming the expression of ROS gene network.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,Expedition 22,Lada,10.26030/4w3q-hk88
OSD-60,Exposure of zebrafish larvae to relative microgravity between 5-6 days post-fertilization,Danio rerio,Ground Study,"The general objective of the study was to determine modulation of gene expression by environmental factors, with a special emphasis on bone formation. For this reason, the specific period of treatment was chosen between 5-6 days post-fertilization (dpf), when bone formation and calcification are taking place. This experiment was designed as a new type of gravitational experiment, which we like to call relative microgravity, referring to the fact that the larvae first grow in hyper gravity for 5 days and are then returned to 1g normal gravity for 1 day. Zebrafish embryos were placed on a Large Diameter Centrifuge at 3 hpf, brought to a gravitational force of 3 g until 5 dpf. Reference embryos were kept in parallel at 1g (Inc). At 5dpf, one batch was left at 3g (3g), one batch was returned to 1g (3g>1g), while a third batch was returned to 1g, but left on the axis of the centrifuge (Axe; 3g>Axe).

OSD-61,Effect of a 91 day long stay in weightlessness on the International Space Station on mouse skin physiology,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Comparative gene expression in skin between mice maintained in microgravity (0g) and normogravity (1g) environment. Six male C57Bl/J10 mice were housed for 91 days in the specially designed Mouse Drawer System in weightlessness aboard the International Space Station. Three wild-type mice (WT) and three transgenic mice overexpressing the osteogneic factor PTN/OSF1 under the control of the human bone specific ostecalcin promoter (Tg) were used in the experiment. During the 3-month stay on the ISS, 3 mice unfortunately died leaving 2 Tg and 1 WT. MDS tissue sharing program allowed several teams to study various tissues from these mice. Our aim was to investigate the effect of such a long period of microgravity on skin physiology by morphological, biochemical and genomewide analyses by comparison to similar mice on ground. Gene expression in the skin of 3 space mice and of 3 ground mice was analyzed by microarray. As this unique experiment performed on 3 mice limits the power of statistical analyis, as the transgene PTN/OSF1 was not overexpressed in skin and as a pair wise Pearson's correlation rates between the individual levels of expressed transcripts in the WT and the Tg mice were not significantly different from each other in one experimental group (space or ground), data from the 3 mice were combined to compare results from the space an ground groups.","Spaceflight

OSD-62,Molecular mechanism of flocculation self-recognition in yeast and its role in mating and survival,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Spaceflight Study,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae flocculation occurs when fermentable sugars are limiting and is therefore considered as a way to enhance the survival chance of Flo-expressing yeast cells. In this paper, the role of Flo1p in mating was demonstrated by showing that the mating efficiency, which contributes to the increased survival rate as well by generating genetic variability, is increased when cells flocculate. This was revealed by liquid growth experiments in a low shear environment and differential transcriptome analysis of FLO1 expressing cells compared to the non-flocculent wild-type cells. The results show that a floc provides a uniquely organized multicellular ultrastructure that provides a suitable microenvironment to induce and perform cell conjugation. S. cerevisiae strains BY4742 WT, BY4742::FLO8 and BY4742 [FLO1] were grown in microgravity and 1-g. A transcriptomic analysis was performed and the transcriptome data were integrated with the high quality protein-protein interaction networks.

Initial analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified 11 Bacillus isolates (two from Kibo Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), four from US Segment Harmony Node 2 and five from Russian Segment Zvezda module sites), all belonging to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group. Isolates were further characterized by whole genome comparative analysis. Each isolate was sequenced, assembled, and aligned against all members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Based on genome size estimates (5.2 - 5.3 Mbp), strain nucleotide identity (>99.99%), and maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement, all isolates were found to exhibit a very high level of similarity. With respect to gene content, all isolates were inspected for cry proteins common to B. thuringiensis as well as toxins specific to B. cereus. No significant hits were found to any known cry genes, while full-length matches were found for multiple B. cereus toxin genes. Finally, the isolates were closely screened against B. anthracis genomes, and no B. anthracis signatures were identified. Notably, all isolates contained the plcR ancestral C allele and lacked significant hits to pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids and toxins. The collective results from the analysis confirm that these strains belong to a previously uncharacterized Bacillus species, hereafter referred to as Bacillus issensis.

The environmental samples were collected with the polyester wipes from eight different locations in the ISS during two consecutive sampling sessions (three months apart). The specific objective was to unveil the viable microbial diversity of each location during two separate sessions in terms of abundance and richness of the communities. The International Space Station (ISS) as a closed built environment has its own environmental microbiome which is shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence. The microbial diversity associated with ISS environmental surfaces was investigated during this study. Polyester wipes and contact slides were used for sampling of eight various surface locations on the ISS at different time periods. The samples were retrieved and analyzed immediately upon the return to the Earth (via Soyuz TMA-14M or Dragon capsule from SpaceX). After surface sample collection, contact slides containing nutrient media for the growth of bacteria and fungi were incubated at 25C. The polyester wipes were processed to measure microbial burden (R2A, Blood Agar, and Potato Dextrose Agar) and recover cultivable bacteria as well as fungi. Subsequently, viable microbial burden was assessed using Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) assay, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods after propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment.

OSD-70,Environmental and facility conditions promote singular gravity responses of transcriptome during Drosophila metamorphosis,Drosophila melanogaster,Ground Study,"Genome-wide transcriptional profiling showed that reducing gravity levels in the International Space Station (ISS) causes important alterations in Drosophila gene expression intimately linked to imposed spaceflight-related environmental constrains during Drosophila metamorphosis. However, simulation experiments on ground testing space-related environmental constraints, show differential responses. Curiously, although particular genes are not common in the different experiments, the same GO groups including a large multigene family related with behavior, stress response and organogenesis are over represented in them. A global and integrative analysis using the gene expression dynamics inspector (GEDI) self-organizing maps, reveals different degrees in the responses of the transcriptome when using different environmental conditions or microgravity/hypergravity simulation devices. These results suggest that the transcriptome is finely tuned to normal gravity. In regular environmental conditions the alteration of this constant parameter on Earth can have mild effects on gene expression but when environmental conditions are far from optimal, the gene expression is much more intense and consistent effects.","Altered Gravity

OSD-71,Immediate Transcriptional Changes in Response to High Dose Radiation Exposure,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the dosage within 1 hour post-exposure, dose-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 Gy with corresponding time point at 1 hour (hr) post-exposure using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 Array chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. A total of sixteen human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.3 Gy, 1.5 Gy and 3.0 Gy at time point 1 hour (hr) post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from four human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all four volunteers were measured at 1 hr for all four dose levels, resulting in four replicates at each dose level. Thus, a total of 4 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 16 samples.","Ionizing Radiation

Analysis of amplicon sequencing data was carried out using the QIIME pipeline. Low LET radiation, high iron diet, and spaceflight increased Bacteroidetes and decreased Firmicutes. Low LET radiation, high Fe diet, and spaceflight did not significantly affect diversity or richness, or elevate pathogenic genera. Spaceflight increased Clostridiales and decreased Lactobacillales, and similar trends were observed in the experiment using a ground-based model of microgravity, suggesting altered gravity may affect colonic microbiota.

It is unknown to what extent the irradiated microenvironment contributes to the differential carcinogenic potential of densely ionizing radiation. To address this gap, 10-week old BALB/c mice were irradiated with 100 cGy sparsely ionizing g-radiation or 10, 30, or 80 cGy of densely ionizing, 350 MeV/amu Si particles and transplanted 3 days later with syngeneic Trp53 null mammary fragments. Tumor appearance was monitored for 600 days. Tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice had a shorter median time to appearance, grew faster and were more likely to metastasize. Most tumors arising in sham-irradiated mice were ER-positive, pseudo-glandular and contained both basal keratin 14 and luminal keratin 8/18 cells (designated K14/18), while most tumors arising in irradiated hosts were K8/18 positive (designated K18) and ER negative. Comparison of K18 vs K14/18 tumor expression profiles showed that genes increased in K18 tumors were associated with ERBB2 and KRAS while decreased genes overlapped with those down regulated in metastasis and by loss of E-cadherin. Consistent with this, K18 tumors grew faster than K14/18 tumors and more mice with K18 tumors developed lung metastases compared to mice with K14/18 tumors. However, K18 tumors arising in Si-particle irradiated mice grew even faster and were more metastatic compared to control mice. A K18 Si-irradiated host profile was enriched in genes involved in mammary stem cells, stroma, and Notch signaling. Thus systemic responses to densely ionizing radiation enriches for a ER-negative, K18-positive tumor, whose biology is more aggressive compared to similar tumors arising in non-irradiated hosts. Key Words: ionizing radiation; breast cancer; heavy ion radiation;initiation; promotion 3 different dose of Si were used. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyzed a total of 45 Trp53-null tumors: 18 from sham-irradiated hosts, 9 from 10 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, 10 from 30 cGy Si-irradiated hosts, and 8 from irradiated hosts.","ionizing radiation

For this reason, the specific period of treatment was chosen between 5-6 days post-fertilization (dpf), when bone formation and calcification are taking place. Zebrafish larvae were placed at 5 dpf into a clinostat (CLINO) for 24 hours, which was shown to simulate microgravity by the specific rotational movements it generates. We show that CLINO exposure causes a clear decrease of bone formation, as illustrated by cranial skeleton staining of the bone matrix by Alizarin Red, by morphometric analysis of the resulting images. Thus, a whole genome micro-array experiment was conducted to identify genes that may be involved in the observed effect on bone formation.",stress,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/w4vh-6165
OSD-78,Transcription profiling of human MCF10A cells subjected to ionizing radiation and treatment with transforming growth factor beta-1,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFbeta) is a tumor suppressor during the initial stage of tumorigenesis, but it can switch to a tumor promoter during neoplastic progression. Ionizing radiation (IR), both a carcinogen and a therapeutic agent, induces TGFbeta activation in vivo. We now show that IR sensitizes human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) to undergo TGFbeta-mediated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Non-malignant HMEC (MCF10A, HMT3522 S1 and 184v) were irradiated with 2 Gy shortly after attachment in monolayer culture, or treated with a low concentration of TGFbeta (0.4 ng/ml), or double-treated. All double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) HMEC underwent a morphological shift from cuboidal to spindle-shaped. This phenotype was accompanied by decreased expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, beta-catenin and ZO-1, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, and increased expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, fibronectin and vimentin. Furthermore, double-treatment increased cell motility, promoted invasion and disrupted acinar morphogenesis of cells subsequently plated in Matrigel. Neither radiation nor TGFbeta alone elicited EMT, even though IR increased chronic TGFbeta signaling and activity. Gene expression profiling revealed that double treated cells exhibit a specific 10-gene signature associated with Erk/MAPK signaling. We hypothesized that IR-induced MAPK activation primes non-malignant HMEC to undergo TGFbeta-mediated EMT. Consistent with this, Erk phosphorylation were transiently induced by irradiation, persisted in irradiated cells treated with TGFbeta, and treatment with U0126, a Mek inhibitor, blocked the EMT phenotype. Together, these data demonstrate that the interactions between radiation-induced signaling pathways elicit heritable phenotypes that could contribute to neoplastic progression. Experiment Overall Design: Nonmalignant human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells (passages 106 and 108) were seeded at cloning density in 35mm dishes (10^5 cells/dish). Cell culture medium consisted of 3ml/dish of MGEM serum free medium (Cambrex Inc.), supplemented or not with 400pg/ml recombinant Transforming Growth Factor-beta. Cells were irradiated or not 5h post plating using 160 KV X-ray with a total dose of 2Gy. Sham, IR-treated, TGFbeta-treated and double-treated (IR+TGFbeta) MCF10A cells were harvested 8 days post-IR. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS, denatured in Trizol, scraped off the dish and subjected to chloroform extraction. After centrifugation, the upper phase was precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol. RNA precipitates were resuspended in RNase free water and further purified on RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Germany). RNA quality was assessed on an Agilent Bio-Analyzer. The dataset analyzed by microarray included biological duplicates for each treatment in two independent experiments and three sham treated samples. Microarray data were generated at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Molecular Profiling Laboratory (http://hta.lbl.gov) using a high-throughput, automated GeneChip system (Affymetrix). Briefly, target preparation, HT_HG-U133A array plate hybridization setup, washing and staining were performed on an Affymetrix robotic system (GCAS) using version 2.1 protocols. Scanning (protocol version 2.2.09) was performed on a CCD-based high throughput scanner (Affymetrix). Samples were analyzed and clustered with the (UNO) One Color GenetrafficTM software version 3.2-12 (Iobion Informatics LLC, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Genes whose expression was specifically altered by treatment were defined as those in which dye ratio was more than 1.75-fold (mean log2ratio>0.8) from baseline in at least three out of the four treated samples compared to the three sham samples. Significance analysis tests (p<0.05) were performed using Excel between sham samples and either IR, TGFbeta or TGFbeta+IR samples.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-79,Murine microenvironment metaprofiles associate with human cancer etiology and intrinsic subtypes,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"We developed a mouse model that captures radiation effects on host biology by transplanting unirradiated Trp53 null mammary tissue to sham or irradiated hosts. Gene expression profiles of tumors that arose in irradiated mice are distinct from those that arose in naive hosts. Host irradiation induces a metaprofile consisting of gene modules representing stem cells, cell motility, macrophages and autophagy. Human orthologs of the host irradiation metaprofile discriminated between radiation-preceded and sporadic human thyroid cancers. An irradiated host centroid was strongly associated with estrogen receptor negative breast cancer. When applied to sporadic human breast cancers, the irradiated host metaprofile strongly associated with basal-like and claudin-low breast cancer intrinsic subtypes. Comparing host irradiation in the context of TGFB levels showed that inflammation was robustly associated with claudin-low tumors. The association of the irradiated host metaprofiles with estrogen receptor negative status and claudin-low subtype suggests that host processes similar to those induced by radiation underlie sporadic cancers. Total RNA was extracted from mammary tumors derived from transplantations of non-irradiated p53null mammary fragments into irradiated hosts. We analyized a total of 32 p53null tumors from irradiated wild type mice: 9 from sham-irradiated hosts, and 23 from irradiated hosts.

OSD-88,Age and Space Irradiation Modulate Tumor Progression: Implications for Carcinogenesis Risk,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is an important consideration when modeling the carcinogenesis process or estimating cancer risks. Epidemiological data show that from adolescence through middle age, cancer incidence increases with age. This effect is commonly attributed to a lifetime accumulation of cellular, particularly DNA, damage. However, during middle-age, the incidence begins to decelerate and, for many tumor sites, it actually decreases at sufficiently advanced ages. We investigated if the observed deceleration and potential decrease in incidence could be attributed to a decreased capacity of older hosts to support tumor progression, and whether HZE (high atomic number (Z), high energy (E)) radiation differentially modulates tumor progression in young versus middle-age hosts, issues relevant to estimating carcinogenesis risk for astronauts. Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were injected into syngeneic mice (143 and 551 days old), which were then subject to whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu). Three findings emerged: 1) among unirradiated animals, substantial inhibition of tumor progression and significantly decreased tumor growth rates were seen for middle-aged mice compared to young mice; 2) whole-body 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) inhibited tumor progression in both young and in middle-aged mice (with greater suppression seen in case of young animals), with little effect on tumor growth rates; and 3) 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) suppressed tumor progression in young mice, to a degree not significantly different than transiting from young to middle-aged. Thus, 56Fe irradiation (1GeV/amu) acted similar to aging with respect to tumor progression. We further investigated the molecular underpinnings driving the radiation modulation of tumor dynamics in young and middle-aged mice. Through global gene expression analysis, the key players, FASN, AKT1, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 complex, were determined to be contributory. In sum, these findings demonstrate a reduced capacity of middle-aged hosts to support the progression phase of carcinogenesis and identify molecular factors contributory to HZE radiation modulation of tumor progression as a function of age. For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. The number of tumor sample replicates used from each condition is as follows: 10 samples from young unirradiated mice, 8 samples from young irradiated mice, 7 samples from middle-aged unirradiated mice, 5 samples from middle-aged irradiated mice. Total RNA was isolated and purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) or RNeasy (Qiagen), quantified and qualified using Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent) and samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had O.D. 260/280 = 1.7 - 2.1, 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN (RNA integrity number) >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using Ambion TotalPrep (Ambion), and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan (Illumina), and the data were analyzed using GenomeStudio (Illumina). Data were first analyzed for gene expression and then culled for present genes (genes that meet the criteria of detection p-value < 0.05). Expression above background was included in an expressed genes working data set for further analyses. Rank variant normalization was applied to the data before extensive analysis. Differential gene expression analysis was used to compare to the reference group, young unirradiated mice, and genes were then evaluated and validated.","Age

OSD-89,Proton Irradiation Impacts Age Driven Modulations of Cancer Progression Influenced by Immune System Transcriptome Modifications from Splenic Tissue,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Age plays a crucial role in the interplay between tumor and host; with further perturbations induced by irradiation. Proton irradiation on tumors induces biological modulations including inhibition of angiogenic and immune factors critical to ''hallmark'' processes impacting tumor development, in addition to physical targeting advantages. These advantages have provided promising results for proton therapy in cancer. Additionally, protons have implications for carcinogenesis risk of space travel (due to the high proportion of high energy protons in space radiation). Through a systems biology approach, we investigated how host tissue (i.e. splenic tissue) of tumor-bearing mice is altered with age, with or without whole-body proton exposure. Transcriptome analysis was performed on splenic tissue from adolescent (68 day) versus old (736 day) C57BL/6 male mice injected with Lewis lung carcinoma cells with or without three fractionations of 0.5Gy (1GeV) proton irradiation. Global transcriptome analysis indicated that proton irradiation of adolescent hosts caused significant signaling changes within splenic tissues that support carcinogenesis within the mice, as compared to old subjects. Increases in cell cycling and immunosuppression in irradiated adolescent hosts with CDK2, MCM7, CD74, and RUVBL2 as the key players were involved in the regulatory changes in host environment response (i.e. spleen). These results suggest a significant biological component to proton irradiation, operative through host age, that would indicate a modulation of host's ability to support carcinogenesis in adolescence and the bestowal of resistance to immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and genetic perturbation by old age.","Age

OSD-90,RNA-seq analysis of mycobacteria stress response to microgravity,Mycobacterium marinum,Ground Study,"The aim of this work is to determine whether mycobacteria have enhanced virulence during space travel and what mechanisms they use to adapt to microgravity. M. marinum and LHM4 were grown in high aspect ratio vessels (HARV) in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS) under normal gravity (NG) or low shear simulated microgravity (MG). To determine the effect of MG on the stress responses activated by the growth conditions, we used RNAseq to examine what genes were expressed. For RNAseq, the bacteria are harvested, RNA isolated and converted DNA (cDNA), and the cDNA sequenced. Using bioinformatics, the amount of expression of the different M. marinum genes were compared between the NG and MG samples. To make sure that we were examining only gene expression changes due to MG, only bacteria in early exponential growth were used in the RNAseq studies. Triplicate NG and MG cultures were used to generate samples of bacteria grown for ~40 hrs. We also grew triplicate cultures for 4 days and then diluted them again and grew them for another ~40 hrs so we could examine gene expression from bacteria exposed for a longer time. In summary, this study determined that waterborne mycobacteria alter their growth, expression of stress responses, and their sensitivity to oxidizing conditions when subjected to growth under MG.","Simulated Microgravity

In this study, we performed whole lung C-ion irradiation using three different strains of mice to examine whether strain-dependent differences in radiation effects occur in high-LET C-ion thoracic irradiation. Murine strain-variance was evaluated by histopathological examination of intra-alveolar hemorrhage that is likely to occur during the early phase after irradiation, and of lung fibrosis during the late phase, occurring more than three months after irradiation. We also performed microarray analysis to identify the key genes that are differentially regulated in different mouse strains after C-ion irradiation and to determine the mechanism of strain-dependent pulmonary damage after high-LET C-ion irradiation. Eight-week old female inbred C3H/He Slc, C57BL/6J Jms Slc and A/J Jms Slc mice (3 kinds of mice) were used. The whole thorax of three mice was locally irradiated at 10 Gy with C-ion beams, with a reference beam, 137Cs gamma-rays (2 kinds of beam).

OSD-95,A Molecular Genetic Basis Explaining Altered Bacterial Behavior in Space,Escherichia coli,Spaceflight Study,"Bacterial behavior has been observed to change during spaceflight. Higher final cell counts, enhanced biofilm formation, increased virulence, and reduced susceptibility to antibiotics have been reported to occur for cells cultured in space . Most of these phenomena are theorized as being an indirect effect of an altered extracellular environment, where the carbon source uptake is inhibited and excreted acidic byproducts buildup around the cell due to the lack of gravity-driven transport forces. However, to date neither spaceflight results, ground-based studies, physical measurement techniques nor computational approaches have provided sufficient evidence needed to confirm this model. Gene expression data from the Antibiotic Effectiveness in Space (AES-1) experiment, however, have now allowed us to look into the biomolecular processes behind these observations and showed a systematic activation of glucose starvation and acid resistance genes. These results corroborate the reduced mass transport model proposed to govern bacterial responses to spaceflight. Furthermore, the gene expression data suggests that metabolism was stimulated in space, which could play a role in causing the observed increase in bacterial cell concentrations in microgravity. Similarly, the decrease in extracellular pH may also be involved with the reported increase in virulence in space.","Microgravity

High-LET is considered to have a higher relative biological effectiveness (RBE) than low-LET radiations. However, the details of the effects have not been clearly determined. The aim of this study was to characterize the difference between high-LET and low LET radiations. The global effects of the three types of high-LET radiations (fast neutron, heavy ion (C) and thermal neutron) were compared with the low-LET radiation (gamma ray) using yeast DNA microarrays. Highly induced genes by the three types of high-LET radiations were those genes related to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was one of the common factors associated with the four types of radiations. Oxidative stress induced by high-LET radiations may be more serious than that induced by gamma rays. Additionally, genes related to protein synthesis and the ubiquitin and proteasome system were detected. This suggests that more protein damages can be induced by high-LET radiation that denatures the proteins in yeast cells. The genes specifically altered by each type of high-LET radiation were also studied. Overall design: This series contains 4 kinds of irradiation-induced gene expression profiles.

However, the specific physiological response of caries-causing bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans to space flight and/or ground-based simulated microgravity has not been extensively investigated. In this study, High Aspect Ratio Vessel (HARV) S. mutans simulated microgravity and normal gravity cultures were assessed for changes in metabolite and transcriptome profiles, H2O2 resistance, and competence in sucrose-containing biofilm media. Stationary phase S. mutans simulated microgravity cultures displayed increased killing by H2O2 compared to normal gravity control cultures, but competence was not affected. RNA-seq analysis revealed that expression of 153 genes was up-regulated >= 2-fold and 94 genes down-regulated >= 2-fold during simulated microgravity HARV growth. These included a number of genes located on extrachromosomal elements, as well as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses. Collectively, these results suggest that growth under microgravity analog conditions promotes changes in S. mutans gene expression and physiology that may translate to an altered cariogenic potential of this organism during space flight missions.

OSD-107,The Role of PTHrP in Osteoblast Response to Microgravity: Implications for Osteoporosis Development.,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Prolonged skeletal unloading through bedrest results in bone loss similar to that observed in elderly osteoporotic patients, but with an accelerated timeframe. This rapid effect on weight-bearing bones is also observed in astronauts who lose up to 2% of their bone mass per month spent in Space. Despite important implications for Spaceflight travellers and bedridden patients on Earth, the exact mechanisms involved in disuse osteoporosis have not been elucidated. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) regulates many physiological processes including skeletal development, and has been proposed as a gravisensor. To investigate the role of PTHrP in microgravity-induced bone loss, trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) from Pthrp+/+ and -/- mice were exposed to simulated microgravity for 6 days. Viability of TOs decreased in inverse proportion to PTHrP expression levels. Microarray analysis of Pthrp+/+ TOs after 6 days at 0g revealed expression changes in genes encoding prolactins,apoptosis and survival molecules, bone metabolism and extra-cellular matrix composition proteins, chemokines, IGF family and Wnt-related signalling molecules. Importantly, 88% of 0g-induced expression changes in Pthrp+/+ cells overlap those observed in Pthrp-/- cells in normal gravity. Pulsatile treatment with PTHrP1-36 peptide during microgravity exposure reversed a large proportion of 0g-induced changes in Pthrp+/+ TOs. Our results confirm PTHrP efficacy as an anabolic agent to prevent microgravity-induced cell death in TOs. Total RNA samples extracted from Pthrp+/+and -/- trabecular osteoblasts (TOs) exposed for 6 days to simulated 0g in Synthecon rotating cell, or left 6 days in culture at 1g. Cells had either been treated with a pulsatile treatment (2 h/day) of PTHrP1-36 peptide (10-8M) or received a change in growth medium. In total: 8 different conditions with 2 replicates each, i.e. Pthrp+/+ TOs at 0g or 1g with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment, and Pthrp-/- TOs at 0g or 1 g,with or without PTHrP1-36 treatment.","treatment

Unsupervised clustering analysis of gene expression segregated samples according to the radiation (IR) response, and time after exposure with 56Fe-IR showing the greatest level of gene modulation. 1H-IR exposures showed little differential transcript modulation. Network analysis categorized the major differentially expressed genes into cell cycle, oxidative responses and transcriptional regulation functional groups. Transcriptional networks identified key nodes regulating expression. Individual transcription factors were inferred to be active at 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. Validation of the signal transduction network by protein analysis showed that particle IR clearly regulates a long lived signaling mechanism for p38 MAPK signaling and NFATc4 activation. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays supported the role of additional key transcription factors GATA-4, STAT-3 and NF-kB as regulators of the response at specific time points. These data suggest that the molecular response to 56Fe-IR is unique and shows long-lasting gene expression in cardiomyocytes, up to 28 days after exposure. Additionally, proteins involved in signal transduction and transcriptional activation via DNA binding play a role in the response to high charge (Z) and energy (E) particles (HZE).

These animals are particularly promising because of their central role in the limnic food web and its mode of reproduction. However, the response of Daphnia to altered gravity conditions has to be investigated, especially on the molecular level, to evaluate the suitability of Daphnia for BLSS in space. Methods: In this study, we applied a proteomic approach to identify key proteins and pathways involved in the response of Daphnia to simulated microgravity generated by a 2D-clinostat. We analysed 5 biological replicates using 2D-DIGE proteomic analysis. Results: We identified 109 protein spots differing in intensity (p < 0.05). Substantial fractions of these proteins are involved in actin microfilament organisation, indicating the disruption of cytoskeletal structures during clinorotation. Furthermore, proteins involved in protein folding were identified, suggesting altered gravity induced breakdown of protein structures in general. In addition, simulated microgravity increased the abundance of energy metabolism related proteins, indicating an enhanced energy demand of Daphnia. Conclusion: The affected biological processes were also described in other studies using different organisms and systems either aiming to simulate microgravity conditions or providing real microgravity conditions. Moreover, most of the Daphnia protein sequences are well conserved throughout taxa, indicating that the response to altered gravity conditions in Daphnia follows a general concept.",Weightlessness Simulation,"protein expression profiling

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which mostly regulate gene expression by degrading the messages or inhibiting translation. Here, we investigated changes in miRNA expression patterns after low (0.1 Gy) and high (2.0 Gy) doses of X-ray in human fibroblasts. At early (0.5 h) and late (6 and 24 h) time points, irradiation caused qualitative and quantitative differences in the down-regulation of miRNA levels, including miR-92b, 137, 660, and 656. A transient up-regulation of miRNAs was observed after 2 h post-irradiation following high doses of radiation, including miR-558 and 662. MicroRNA levels were inversely correlated with targets from mRNA and proteomic profiling after 2.0 Gy of radiation. MicroRNAs miR-579, 608, 548-3p, and 585 are noted for targeting genes involved in radioresponsive mechanisms, such as cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We suggest here a model in which miRNAs may act as hub regulators of specific cellular responses, immediately down-regulated so as to stimulate DNA repair mechanisms, followed by up-regulation involved in suppressing apoptosis for cell survival. Taken together, miRNAs may mediate signaling pathways in sequential fashion in response to radiation, and may serve as biodosimetric markers of radiation exposure. Overall design: The gene expression patterns in human fibroblasts after 2.0 Gy of low-LET radiation was determined at 2 and 24 hrs post-irradiation time in technical triplicates.

The reduction in gravity, or microgravity, represents a novel environment that can disrupt homeostasis of many physiological processes. Additionally, it is becoming increasingly clear that an organism's microbiome is critical for host health and examining its resiliency in microgravity represents a new frontier for space biology research. In this study, we examine the impact of microgravity on the interactions between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri, which form a highly specific binary mutualism. First, animals inoculated with V. fischeri aboard the space shuttle showed effective colonization of the host light organ, the site of the symbiosis, during spaceflight. Second, RNA-Seq analysis of squid exposed to modeled microgravity conditions exhibited extensive differential gene expression in the presence and absence of the symbiotic partner. Transcriptomic analyses revealed in the absence of the symbiont during modeled microgravity there was an enrichment of genes and pathways associated with the innate immune and oxidative stress response. The results suggest that V. fischeri may help modulate the host stress responses under modeled microgravity.

OSD-120,Genetic dissection of the Arabidopsis spaceflight transcriptome: Are some responses dispensable for the physiological adaptation of plants to spaceflight?,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in establishing the spaceflight responses are being identified, their roles in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are actually required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses in the root tips of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD plants displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed an even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the cost of spaceflight adaptation, as measured by transcriptional response. These differential genotypic responses suggest that genetic manipulation could further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.","Ecotype

Pellet cultures of hMSCs formed cartilaginous tissue under the addition of growth factors (FGF; TGF-beta3). Pure SMG reduced COLXA1 expression but also COL2A expression of hMSCs. Pure EMF showed no gene expression changes of hMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. Combining EMF/SMG resulted in a re-increase of COL2A but did not reach control levels. The COL2A to COLXA1 ratio of combined EMF/SMG was not significantly different from control levels. The combination therapy of EMF/SMG did not significantly improve the chondrogenic potential of hMSCs. chondrogenic differentiation, electromagnetic stimulation-control, 1 timepoint with/without stimulation.",Electromagnetic Fields,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/6fwd-2p79

Two replicates of test (Microgravity) and control (static), each from DLD-1 and MOLT-4 were analyzed by microarray. Simulated microgravity affected the solid tumor cell line DLD-1 markedly which showed a higher percentage of dysregulated genes compared to the hematological tumor cell line, MOLT-4. Microgravity affects the cell cycle of DLD-1 cells and disturbs expression of cell cycle regulatory gene networks.

Microgravity and 3D culture can profoundly modulate cell proliferation and survival. Here, we engineered microscale progenitor cardiac spheres from human pluripotent stem cells and exposed the spheres to simulated microgravity using a random positioning machine for 3 days during their differentiation to cardiomyocytes. Methods: RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq RNA kit and the TrueSeq method was employed for mRNA enrichment. The libraries were quantified and samples were multiplexed in each lane of the flowcell. Cluster generation was performed and then sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq1000 system. Reads were mapped on the Human Genome Reference and normalized expression table was generated. Results: Among differentially expressed genes, 53 of them were up-regulated and 75 were down-regulated. Conclusions: Data demonstrate increased expression of genes associated with growth, development, and pro-survival in cardiac progenitors cultured under simulated microgravity compared with those cultured under standard gravity.

OSD-128,Identification of miRNAs involved in cell response to ionising radiation and modeled microgravity,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"BACKGROUND: Ionizing radiation (IR) can be extremely harmful for human cells since an improper DNA-damage response (DDR) to IR can contribute to carcinogenesis initiation. Perturbations in DDR pathway can originate from alteration in the functionality of the microRNA-mediated gene regulation, being microRNAs (miRNAs) small noncoding RNA that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study we gained insight into the role of miRNAs in the regulation of DDR to IR under microgravity, a condition of weightlessness experienced by astronauts during space missions, which could have a synergistic action on cells, increasing the risk of radiation exposure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed miRNA expression profile of human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) incubated for 4 and 24 h in normal gravity (1 g) and in modeled microgravity (MMG) during the repair time after irradiation with 0.2 and 2Gy of gamma-rays. Our results show that MMG alters miRNA expression signature of irradiated PBL by decreasing the number of radio-responsive miRNAs. Moreover, let-7i*, miR-7, miR-7-1*, miR-27a, miR-144, miR-200a, miR-598, miR-650 are deregulated by the combined action of radiation and MMG. Integrated analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, carried out on PBL of the same donors, identified significant miRNA-mRNA anti-correlations of DDR pathway. Gene Ontology analysis reports that the biological category of Response to DNA damage is enriched when PBL are incubated in 1 g but not in MMG. Moreover, some anti-correlated genes of p53-pathway show a different expression level between 1 g and MMG. Functional validation assays using luciferase reporter constructs confirmed miRNA-mRNA interactions derived from target prediction analyses. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: On the whole, by integrating the transcriptome and microRNome, we provide evidence that modeled microgravity can affects the DNA-damage response to IR in human PBL.","Simulated Microgravity

We identified a novel role for RAD51 in innate immune response signaling. Defects in RAD51 lead to the accumulation of self-DNA in the cytoplasm, triggering a STING-mediated innate immune response after replication stress and DNA damage. Our data suggest that in addition to playing roles in homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair and replication fork processing, RAD51 is also implicated in the suppression of innate immunity. Thus, our study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of RAD51 in initiating immune signaling, placing it at the hub of new interconnections between DNA replication, DNA repair, and immunity.

OSD-131,Proton irradiation augments the reduction in tumor progression observed with advanced age,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Proton irradiation is touted for its improved tumor targeting due to the physical advantages of ion beams for radiotherapy. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that, in addition to targeting advantages, proton irradiation can inhibit angiogenic and immune factors and thereby modulate tumor progression. High-energy protons also constitute a principal component of the galactic cosmic rays to which astronauts are exposed. Increased understanding of the biological effects of proton exposure would thus contribute to both improved cancer therapy and carcinogenesis risk assessment for space travel. In addition, age plays a major role in tumor incidence and is a critical consideration for estimating cancer risk. We investigated the effects of host age and proton exposure on tumor progression. Tumor lag time and growth dynamics were tracked following injection of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells into young (68 day) versus old (736 day) mice with or without coincident irradiation. Tumor progression was suppressed in old compared to young mice. Differences in progression were further modulated by proton irradiation (1GeV), with increased inhibition evident in old mice. Through global transcriptome analysis, TGFB1 and TGFB2 were determined to be key players that contributed to the tumor dynamics observed. These findings point to older hosts providing decreased systemic tumor support, which can be further inhibited by proton irradiation. Overall design: For genome-wide expression profiling of tumor tissue, Mouse WG-6 BeadArray chips (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used. Total RNA was amplified with the Ambion Illumina TotalPrep Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and labeled from all replicate biological samples for each condition. For tumor replicates, thirty tumor samples from adolescent and thirty tumor samples from old mice, for a total of 60 tumor samples, were used. All replicate samples were run individually. For each age group, ten tumor samples had received proton irradiation while twenty tumor samples were from unirradiated mice (as described above). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Samples were deemed suitable for amplification and hybridization if they had 28s/18s = 2:1, RIN >7. Total RNA of 500ng per sample was amplified using AmbionTotalPrep, and 1.5ug of the product was loaded onto the chips. Following hybridization at 55C, the chips were washed and then scanned using the Illumina iScan System. The data was checked with GenomeStudio (Illumina) for quality control. In GenomeStudio, data was background subtracted and rank invariant normalization was applied. Data was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer, MeV, for statistical analysis.

Moreover, osteoclast rsorbing activity was affected by hypergravity, indicating the possibility that we can investigate the effect of microgravity on osteoclasts in space. To find this effect, we examine the alteration of osteoclast activity under microgravity with the histological analysis or the expression analysis by RNA in-situ hybridization. Furthermore, since we have succeeded the establishment of the medaka osteoclast-specific transgenic lines, we perform the in-vivo imaging analyses for gene expression and cell mobility.

High altitude, for example, presents terrestrial hypobaria always with hypoxia as a component stress, since the relative partial pressure of O2 is constant in the atmosphere. Laboratory-controlled hypobaria, however, allows the dissection of pressure effects away from the effects typically associated with altitude, in particular hypoxia, as the partial pressure of O2 can be varied. In this study, whole transcriptomes of plants grown in ambient (97 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa) atmospheric conditions were compared to those of plants transferred to five different atmospheres of varying pressure and oxygen composition for 24 h: 50 kPa/pO2 equals 10 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2 equals 5 kPa, 50 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa, 25 kPa/pO2 equals 21 kPa, or 97 kPa/pO2 equals 5 kPa. The plants exposed to these environments were 10 day old Arabidopsis seedlings grown vertically on hydrated nutrient plates. In addition, 5 day old plants were also exposed for 24 h to the 50 kPa and ambient environments to evaluate age-dependent responses. The gene expression profiles from roots and shoots showed that the hypobaric response contained more complex gene regulation than simple hypoxia, and that adding back oxygen to normoxic conditions did not completely alleviate gene expression changes in hypobaric responses.","Atmospheric Pressure

At present no study investigated the complexity of the molecular changes in human or mouse paraspinal muscles exposed to microgravity.

In particular, loss of muscle mass and strength are triggered by weightlessness in humans during space flights, that is similarly observed as a result of physical inactivity conditions and aging on Earth. However, skeletal muscle tissue is of paramount importance for health maintenance (e.g. being essential to locomotion, heat production, and metabolism). To better prevent or eventually treat microgravity-induced muscle atrophy, its underlying mechanisms have first to be characterized in detail. Using cutting-edge quantitative proteomics, the aim of the present study was therefore to get an in depth view of the molecular regulations triggered by space conditions in skeletal muscles of mice during the 30-day flight of the BION-M1 biosatellite.

OSD-140,Dynamic nature of epigenetic patterns observed during the Mars 520-d mission simulation,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Interplanetary human spaceflight represents a formidable medical challenge, but also provides a unique platform for investigating human adaptation to extreme environmental changes. Understanding the long-term effects of isolation has relevance in a range of scenarios and it is well recognized that a better understanding of the relationship between environmental exposure and the epigenome can lead to more effective preventive measures. Here we conduct a longitudinal epigenetic, mood state and biochemical profiling of 6 crew members in an experiment simulating a 520-day mission to Mars. Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip was used to obtain DNA methylation profiles. Firstly, we found that long-term isolation can induce global DNA methylation remodeling, and this change seems to be an active adaptation (rather than a random process or a by-product of the isolation). This study is the first to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between global epigenetic remodeling and isolation-induced mood state and biochemical changes. Secondly, by considering the location of methylation sites within the genome and using gene-pathway annotation, we were able to identify pathways that were significantly enriched in methylation events and consider their association with specific function and the timeline of the mission. Thirdly, via our definition of epi-entropy, a measure of entropy adapted to methylation events, we observed that the methylation remodeling produced a marked reduction in epi-entropy. Results suggest that DNA methylation change is an indicator of change rather than its by-product, i.e., there is a psychology-epigenome-metabolism model of long-term depression; DNA methylation programs the environment signal into the epigenome, which is subsequently transformed into the biochemical output and health outcome. Thus, longitudinal epigenetic profiling could code the effect of isolation and act as early indicators of latent health outcome.

In particular, splenic B-cell numbers decrease during spaceflight and in ground-based physiological models. Although antibody isotype changes have been assessed during and after spaceflight, an extensive characterization of the impact of spaceflight on antibody composition has not been conducted in mice. Next Generation Sequencing and bioinformatic tools are now available to assess antibody repertoires. We can now identify immunoglobulin gene- segment usage, junctional regions, and modifications that contribute to specificity and diversity. Due to limitations on the International Space Station, alternate sample collection and storage methods must be employed. Our group compared Illumina MiSeq sequencing data from multiple sample preparation methods in normal C57Bl/6J mice to validate that sample preparation and storage would not bias the outcome of antibody repertoire characterization. In this report, we also compared sequencing techniques and a bioinformatic workflow on the data output when we assessed the IgH and IgŒ∫ variable gene usage.

Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap.

OSD-151,Bystander response to 2.5 Gy of protons in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16 h after exposure,,,"Bystander mechanisms that originate in the areas surrounding a tissue damage presumably play an important role participating in wound healing and tissue remodeling. Thus, identification and characterization of bystander mechanisms will help to development of new treatments of patients with a radiation exposure. In the present study, we irradiated 3-dimensional tissue model of human epidermis, Epi-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), with 2.5 Gy protons. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in directly irradiated and bystander cells located at 0.125-0.375, 0.375-0.625, 0.625-875 mm from the irradiation line. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis and network analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems) and IPA (Ingenuity), accordingly. Significantly responding genes were identified at all distances and included sets common to both direct and bystander responses. False discovery rate in bystander samples did not exceed 20% (p=0.001) and was sufficiently low in the samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure (0.06-1.16%). Analysis of the fragments cut at the same distance revealed 52, 54 and 88 differentially expressed genes. These gene lists overlapped each other had from 3 to 12 genes in common including CLED2, S100A7A. Samples obtained after the whole tissue exposure discovered 949 differentially expressed genes. Moreover, the performed gene ontology analysis showed there overrepresentation of TP53 pathway (pathways, p=2.04E-02), a common marker of direct irradiation response, and also overrepresentation of the following groups of genes: signal transduction (p=4.52E-04), cell communication (p=1.24E-04) and cell cycle in the category of biological processes; DNA helicase activity (p=2.54E-07), receptor binding (p=6.19E-04), calcium ion binding proteins (p=2.57E-03) as the molecular functions. Differentially expresses genes of bystander samples had few categories in common such as cell communication (p=2.36E-03) and signal transduction (p=2.42E-03) among the biological processes and receptor activity (p=4.54E-03) among the molecular functions. Categories specific for the bystander samples included G-protein coupled receptors (p=7.24E-03) and ligand-gated ion channels (p=4.16E-03) suggesting a role of external stimulation and ion trafficking in bystander mechanisms. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 2.5 Gy of protons. Four independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-375, 375-625 and 625-875 micrometers) using three tissue fragments per a data point. Moreover, three sets of whole tissue irradited samples were also generated for 0 and 2.5 Gy (6 samples total) and used for comparison of bystander and direct responses.","Ionizing Radiation

Human peripheral blood from healthy donors was irradiated ex vivo, and a 74-gene consensus signature was identified that distinguished between four radiation doses (0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy) and control samples. The same set of genes separated samples by exposure level at both six and 24 hours after treatment, with overlap evident only at the highest two doses (5 and 8 Gy). Expression of five genes (CDKN1A, FDXR, SESN1, BBC3 and PHPT1) from this signature was quantified in the same RNA samples by real-time PCR, confirming low variability between donors as well as the predicted radiation response pattern. Experiment Overall Design: Radiation induced gene expression in human blood was measured at 6 and 24 hours after exposure to doses of 0, 0.5, 2, 5 and 8 Gy g-rays.

OSD-153,Non-targeted effects of low dose ionizing radiation act via TGF-beta to promote mammary carcinogenesis,,Ground Study,"This is a genome-wide approach to identifying genes persistently induced in the mouse mammary gland by acute whole body low dose ionizing radiation (10cGy), 1 and 4 weeks after exposure. Gene expression that is modified under these parameters were compared between Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote littermates in order to determine which genes induced or repressed by radiation were mediated via Tgfb1 status. Differential gene expression was analyzed in Tgfb1 heterozygote and wild type littermate 4th mammary glands, after whole body exposure to an acute dose of 10cGy ionizing radiation. Estrus cycle was normalized in all mice two days prior to irradiation by injection with an estrogen and progesterone mixture. It is widely believed that the carcinogenic action of ionizing radiation is due to targeted DNA damage and resulting mutations, but there is also substantial evidence that non-targeted radiation effects alter epithelial phenotype and the stromal microenvironment. Activation of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFbeta) is a non-targeted radiation effect that mediates cell fate decisions following DNA damage and regulates microenvironment composition; it could either suppress or promote cancer. Gene expression profiling shown herein demonstrates that low dose radiation (10 cGy) elicits persistent changes in Tgfb1 wild type and heterozygote murine mammary gland that are highly modulated by TGFbeta. We asked if such non-targeted radiation effects contribute to carcinogenesis by using a novel radiation chimera model. Unirradiated Trp53 null mammary epithelium was transplanted to the mammary stroma of mice previously exposed to a single low (10 -100 cGy) radiation dose. By 300 days, 100% of transplants in irradiated hosts at either 10 or 100 cGy had developed Trp53 null breast carcinomas compared to 54% in unirradiated hosts. Tumor growth rate was also increased by high, but not low, dose host irradiation. In contrast, irradiation of Tgfb1 heterozygote mice prior to transplantation failed to decrease tumor latency, or increase growth rate at any dose. Host irradiation significantly reduced the latency of invasive ductal carcinoma compared to spindle cell carcinoma, as well as those tumors negative for smooth muscle actin in wild type but not Tgfb1 heterozygote mice. However, irradiation of either host genotype significantly increased the frequency of estrogen receptor negative tumors. These data demonstrate two concepts critical to understanding radiation risks. First, non-targeted radiation effects can significantly promote the frequency and alter the features of epithelial cancer. Second, radiation-induced TGFbeta activity is a key mechanism of tumor promotion.

Potential confounding factors have not been fully addressed for gene expression-based biodosimetry approaches, such as we are developing. To begin addressing this need, we have used an ex vivo irradiated peripheral blood cell model to investigate the potential effect of smoking on the global radiation gene expression response, and looked for genes that respond to radiation differently in smokers and non-smokers, and also in males and females. The results indicate that only a small number of genes may be significantly confounded by either factor, supporting the idea of developing peripheral blood gene expression strategies for radiation biodosimetry. Blood from each of 24 different donors was exposed to four doses of ionizing radiation (0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2 Gy) and analyzed using single-color microarray hybridization. The donors represented equal numbers of male and female smokers (1 or more packs a day) and non-smokers.

When ingested or inhaled, it can expose the entire body for an extended period of time, potentially contributing to serious health consequences ranging from acute radiation syndrome to increased cancer risks. In order to identify changes in gene expression that may be informative for detecting such exposure, and to begin examining the molecular responses involved, we have profiled global gene expression in mice injected with 137CsCl. We extracted RNA from the blood of control or 137CsCl-injected mice at 2, 3, 5, 20 or 30 days after exposure.

OSD-160,Gene expression data from 4T1 irradiated tumors treated with TGFbeta blockade,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Accumulating data support the concept that ionizing radiation therapy (RT) has the potential to convert the tumor into an in situ, individualized vaccine; however this potential is rarely realized by RT alone. Transforming growth factor Œ≤ (TGFŒ≤) is an immunosuppressive cytokine that is activated by RT and inhibits the antigen-presenting function of dendritic cells and the differentiation of effector CD8+ T cells. Here we tested the hypothesis that TGFŒ≤ hinders the ability of RT to promote anti-tumor immunity. Development of tumor-specific immunity was examined in a pre-clinical model of metastatic breast cancer. Mice bearing established 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma treated with pan-isoform specific TGFŒ≤ neutralizing antibody, 1D11, showed significantly improved control of the irradiated tumor and non-irradiated metastases, but no effect in the absence of RT. Notably, whole tumor transcriptional analysis demonstrated the selective upregulation of genes associated with immune-mediated rejection only in tumors of mice treated with RT+TGFŒ≤ blockade. Mice treated with RT+TGFŒ≤ blockade exhibited cross-priming of CD8+ T cells producing IFNŒ≥ in response to three tumor-specific antigens in tumor-draining lymph nodes, which was not evident for single modality treatment. Analysis of the immune infiltrate in mouse tumors showed a significant increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells only in mice treated with the combination of RT+TGFŒ≤ blockade. Depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells abrogated the therapeutic benefit of RT+TGFŒ≤ blockade. These data identify TGFŒ≤ as a master inhibitor of the ability of RT to generate an in situ tumor vaccine, which supports testing inhibition of TGFŒ≤ during radiotherapy to promote therapeutically effective anti-tumor immunity. We used genome-wide microarray to depict main biological processes responsibles for the therapeutic benefit of the combination ofTGF-beta blockade and local radiotherapy. To gain a more comprehensice protrait of the effects of RT and TGFbeta blockade on gene expressionin tumors, we collected 4T1 tumors 4 days after completion of RT. Three tumors from each group were then subjected to RNA extraction and hybridization on affymetrix array.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-164,Effects of spaceflight on the immunoglobulin repertoire of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Spaceflight has been shown to suppress the adaptive immune response, altering the distribution and function of lymphocyte populations. B lymphocytes express highly specific and highly diversified receptors, known as immunoglobulins (Ig), that directly bind and neutralize pathogens. Ig diversity is achieved through the enzymatic splicing of gene segments within the genomic DNA of each B cell in a host. The collection of Ig specificities within a host, or Ig repertoire, has been increasingly characterized in both basic research and clinical settings using high-throughput sequencing technology (HTS). We utilized HTS to test the hypothesis that spaceflight affects the B-cell repertoire. To test this hypothesis, we characterized the impact of spaceflight on the unimmunized Ig repertoire of C57BL/6 mice that were flown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) during the Rodent Research One validation flight in comparison to ground controls. Individual gene segment usage was similar between ground control and flight animals, however, gene segment combinations and the junctions in which gene segments combine was varied among animals within and between treatment groups. We also found that spontaneous somatic mutations in the IgH and Ig√É≈Ω√Ç¬∫ gene loci were not increased. These data suggest that space flight did not affect the B cell repertoire of mice flown and housed on the ISS over a short period of time.","Spaceflight

To address this problem, we designed, installed, and flight-validated a novel Aircraft Bioaerosol Collector (ABC) for NASA's C-20A that can make collections for microbiological research investigations up to altitudes of 13.7 km. Herein we report results from the first set of science flights‚Äîfour consecutive missions flown over the United States (US) from 30 October to 2 November, 2017. To ascertain how the concentration of airborne bacteria changed across the tropopause, we collected air during aircraft Ascent/Descent (0.3 to 11 km), as well as sustained Cruise altitudes in the lower stratosphere (~12 km). Bioaerosols were captured on DNA-treated gelatinous filters inside a cascade air sampler, then analyzed with molecular and culture-based characterization. Several viable bacterial isolates were recovered from flight altitudes, including Bacillus sp., Micrococcus sp., Arthrobacter sp., and Staphylococcus sp. from Cruise samples and Brachybacterium sp. from Ascent/Descent samples. Using 16S V4 sequencing methods for a culture-independent analysis of bacteria, the average number of total OTUs was 305 for Cruise samples and 276 for Ascent/Descent samples. Some taxa were more abundant in the flight samples than the ground samples, including OTUs from families Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae as well as the following genera: Clostridium, Mogibacterium, Corynebacterium, Bacteroides, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, and Parabacteroides. Surprisingly, our results revealed a homogeneous distribution of bacteria in the atmosphere up to 12 km. The observation could be due to atmospheric conditions producing similar background aerosols across the western US, as suggested by modeled back trajectories and satellite measurements. However, the influence of aircraft-associated bacterial contaminants could not be fully eliminated and that background signal was reported throughout our dataset. Considering the tremendous engineering challenge of collecting biomass at extreme altitudes where contamination from flight hardware remains an ever-present issue, we note the utility of using the stratosphere as a proving ground for planned life detection missions across the solar system.","Altitude

OSD-175,IMR90 4hr bystander experiment 0.5Gy alpha particle strip dish format,Homo sapiens,Ground study,"Radiation affects tissue and cellular integrity at the level of DNA, protein and metabolites of the cell and extracellular space. The effects of radiation are not limited to targeted cells and tissue and radiation induced bystander effects are significant to exposed individuals in accidental or therapeutic situations. These non-targeted effects of radiation have been studied extensively at the low dose range where they appear to have adverse effects on cells and surrounding environments. The requirement of cellular contact and shared fluid media has been established as critical to the bystander effect yet there is not much known about the actual signaling mechanism and its ability to transmit the damaging effect over space and time. Experimental cell types and context within the tissue are also quite important to the nature and extent of this bystander effect and must be considered when drawing parallels at the organismal level. Our approach was to use a genomic level analysis of global mRNA expression in primary lung fibroblast cells to understand the cellular triggers and mechanism of the bystander effect. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the p53 induced transcriptional response appears muted in bystanders while cytokine and cell signaling mechanisms such as those controlled by NFkB and p38 MAPK are highly active in both populations. We validated a large number of genes that are significantly changed at 4hrs after irradiation in both irradiated and bystander populations. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of cyclooxygenase2 (PTGS2), interleukin 8 (IL8) and BCL2 related protein 2 (BCL2A1), as genes that are involved in cellular signaling via the NFkB pathway, which revealed that there is a dramatic response at 0.5hr after irradiation followed by another wave at 4hr in both populations. The induction of interleukins such as cytokine IL8 and chemokine IL6 at the transcriptional level is both early and amplified and if followed by translation and secretion of these proteins could explain the concerted response seen in bystander cells. Our results are the first to show that there is a significant and distinct global response of cellular signaling genes in bystander cells with some genes showing a response as early as 0.5hr after irradiation which implies a fast moving intercellular signal that leads to a concerted response in the irradiated and bystander populations.

OSD-176,IMR90 bystander experiment 0.5 Gy alpha particle,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"The existence of a radiation bystander effect, in which non-irradiated cells respond to signals from irradiated cells, is well established. It raises concerns for the interpretation of risks from exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation. Sparse data exists about the bystander signaling mechanisms and the ability to transmit damaging effects both spatially and temporally. To understand early signaling and cellular changes in bystanders, we have measured global gene expression 30 minutes after direct and bystander exposure to alpha particle in primary human lung fibroblasts. Gene ontology and pathway analyses suggested that the earliest measured changes at 30 minutes after treatment are in cell structure, motility and adhesion categories and a significant number of genes belong to the category of inflammation and cell-to-cell communication. We investigated time course gene expression profiles of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3 (MMP1 and MMP3), chemokine ligands 2, 3 and 5 (CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL5), interleukins 1a, 1b, 6 and 33 (IL1A, IL1B, IL6 and IL33) growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and superoxide dismutase2 (SOD2) by real time quantitative PCR. These encode proteins involved in cellular signaling via the NFkappaB pathway and time course of mRNA levels revealed an increased response at 30 minutes after irradiation followed by another wave at 4 to 6 hours. We also investigated protein modifications in the AKT-GSK-3 signaling pathway and found that in irradiated cells AKT and GSK3beta are hyper-phosphorylated at 30 minutes and this effect is maintained until 4 hours after exposure. In bystanders there is a similar response with a delay of 30 minutes. In irradiated cells, inactivated GSK3beta led to decreased phosphorylation of beta-catenin. Our results are the first to show that the radiation induced bystander signal can induce a widespread gene expression response as early as 30 minutes after exposure and that these changes are accompanied by protein modification of signaling modules such as AKT and GSK3beta.

OSD-178,IMR90 radiation bystander time-course experiment 0.5Gy alpha particle,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"The radiation bystander effect is an important component of the overall biological response of tissues and organisms to ionizing radiation. Little is known about the contribution of genome level changes in neighboring bystander cells to tissue and organ stress after irradiation. The timing of these changes is critical in the physiological context and these questions can only be answered by studying signaling and global transcriptomics in a chronological way. Here, we present a strategy to identify different biologically important signaling modules that act in concert in the radiation and bystander responses. We used time series gene expression analysis of normal human fibroblast cells measured at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after exposure to radiation coupled with a novel clustering method targeted to short time series, Feature Based Partitioning around medoids Algorithm (FBPA), to look for genes that were potentially co-regulated. This method uses biologically meaningful features of the expression profile and dimension augmentation to address the analysis of sparse data sets such as ours. We applied FBPA and Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) to the same datasets and present the results of our comparisons using computational metrics as well as biological enrichment. Enrichment showed that gene expression in irradiated cells fell into broad categories of signal transduction, cell cycle/cell death and inflammation/immunity; but only FBPA clustered functions well. In bystander cells, the gene expression response was also broadly categorized into functions associated with cell communication and motility, signal transduction and inflammation; but neither STEM nor FBPA separated biological functions as well as in irradiated samples. Network analysis revealed that p53 and NF-kappaB were central players in gene expression in both irradiated and bystander gene clusters. Analysis of individual clusters also suggested new regulators of gene expression in the radiation and bystander response that may act at the epigenetic level such as histone deacetylases (HDAC1 and HDAC2) and methylases (KDM5B) that can act as strong transcription repressors. Based on these results, we propose a novel time series clustering method, FBPA, as a powerful approach that can be applied to sparse data sets (including genomic profiling data), where the choice of features selected for clustering and stringent statistical outcome analysis can augment our knowledge of the underlying cellular mechanisms in biological processes. There are 72 total samples, 4 corresponding biological replicates of IMR90 cells that were not irradiated (control=C), irradiated (alpha=A) and bystander (B), cells were harvested at 0.5 hour, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after treatment","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-182,"Human skin fibroblast mitochondrial depletion, 0.5 Gy alpha-particle",Homo sapiens,Ground study,"Mitochondrial DNA-depleted human skin fibroblasts (HSF rho0) with suppressed oxidative phosphorylation were characterized by significant changes in the expression of 2100 nuclear genes, encoding numerous protein classes, in NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling pathways and by decreased activity of the mitochondrial death pathway, compared to the parent rho+ HSF. In contrast, the extrinsic TRAIL/TRAIL-Receptor-mediated death pathway remained highly active, and exogenous TRAIL induced higher levels of apoptosis in rho0 cells compared to rho+ HSF. Global gene expression analysis using microarray and quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that expression levels of many growth factors and their adaptor proteins (FGF13, HGF, IGFBP4, IGFBP6, IGFL2), cytokines (IL6, IL17B, IL18, IL19, IL28B) and cytokine receptors (IL1R1, IL21R, IL31RA) were substantially decreased after mitochondrial depletion. Some of these genes were targets of NF-kappaB and STAT3, and their protein products could regulate the STAT3 signaling pathway. Alpha-irradiation induced expression of several NF-kappaB/STAT3 target genes, including IL1A, IL1B, IL6, PTGS2/COX2 and MMP12, in rho+ HSF, but this response was substantially decreased in rho0 HSF. Suppression of the IKK-NF-kappaB pathway by the small molecular inhibitor BMS-345541 and of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway by AG490 dramatically increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the control and irradiated rho+ HSF. Inhibitory antibodies against IL6, the main activator of JAK2-STAT3 pathway, added into the cell media, also increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in rho+ HSF. However, NF-kappaB activation was partially lost in mitochondrial DNA-depleted HSF resulting in downregulation of the basal or radiation-induced expression of numerous NF-kappaB targets, further suppressing IL6-JAK2-STAT3, that in concert with NF-kappaB, regulated protection against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. There are 12 total samples, 3 biological replicates each of HSF rho+ and rho0 cells that were not irradiated (control=C) or irradiated (alpha=A).

OSD-183,Radiation-induced bystander effects and gene expression in cells deficient for RAD9,,Ground Study,"Background: The radiation bystander response is an important component of the overall response of cells to radiation and critical to understanding health risks of radiation exposure to humans. The mechanism of radiation response includes inter-cellular signaling and intra-cellular communication by which the bystander signal is propagated. Methods: We measured the bystander response to 1Gy a-particle radiation in Mrad9-/- mouse stem cells and H1299shRAD9 cells, using chromosomal aberration and micronucleus formation as DNA damage endpoints. In the H1299 model we used whole genome microarray analyses to profile the transcriptome of irradiated and bystander cells. Results: We investigated the role of RAD9 in the bystander response and showed that depletion or mutation of RAD9 had an effect of increasing chromosomal structural damage as well as micronucleus formation in bystander cells. The enhancement of the damage effect correlated strongly with a transcriptomic response in critical pathways. RAD9 depletion affected many pathways in the cell, including the UV-MAPK pathway, involving p38MAPK members, STAT1 and PARP1 at the mRNA levels. There was an overall reduction of RNA biogenesis of gene members of this pathway suggesting that perhaps these signaling pathways do not function optimally after RAD9 depletion. Using network analysis we found there may be differential activation of transcriptional regulators between the irradiated and bystander cells involving the SP1 and NUPR1 transcription factors. Network analysis also suggested that HIF1a (Hypoxia induced factor 1a) activation could be a negative predictor of the bystander effect and perhaps that local hypoxic stress observed by cells that are directly exposed to radiation may predict whether or not they will elicit a bystander response. Gene expression in H1299 cells was measured at 4 hours after exposure to 1 Gy a-particles. There were two groups based on RAD9 status, RAD9 normal and RAD9 depleted by siRNA. In each of these groups, sham irradiated, direct irradiated cells for positive bystanders, positive bystanders, direct irradiated cells for negative bystanders and negative bystanders; were identified based on micronucleus responses. Five biological replicates were analyzed for each experimental group.","Rad9 Status

We address this question in the land snail Helix lucorum exposed to 30 days of near weightlessness aboard the Bion-M1 satellite, and studied geotactic behavior of postflight snails, differential gene expressions in statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses of mechanoreceptors to applied tilts. Each approach revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system assumed in response to spaceflight. Absence of light during the mission also affected statocyst physiology, as revealed by comparison to dark-conditioned control groups. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred at ~20 h following return to Earth.

OSD-205,HSFA2 functions in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated plant cells to spaceflight microgravity environment,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"The Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2), as a part of the HSF network, is essential to the plant's response to almost any environmental stress and to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms. Plant cell cultures disabled in HsfA2 function were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in order to ascertain whether or not they use the same terrestrially effective systems to adapt to the novel environment of spaceflight. Cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild type (WT) cultivar Col-0 and from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were launched to the ISS on SpaceX-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC17 spaceflight mission and were fixed in-flight after 10 days on orbit. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the environments (spaceflight to ground) within cells of the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, gene expression profiles were identified between the genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, defining genes uniquely required by the two genotypes in the ground and spaceflight adapted states. The physiological state of the cells as a result of disabling a gene has tremendous control over the mechanisms induced to adapt to the environment of spaceflight. The HsfA2 demonstrated a role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment since the cells disabled in the HsfA2 gene used substantially different genes to achieve the spaceflight adapted state than the WT cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state regardless of the environment and likely result from the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. HsfA2 seems to have a universal stress response role but also specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction and starch biosynthesis. Implementation of knock-out cells identified a set of genes with a required expression level in order for a cell to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state. The HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the adaption of wild type cells to the environment of spaceflight.","Spaceflight

Obtaining root apex transcriptomes is therefore challenging when the samples are limited. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined, comparing RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to microarrays in characterizing genes that are relevant to spaceflight.Methods:Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia ecotype (Col-0) roots were sectioned into Zone 1 (0.5 mm; root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone 2 (1.5 mm; transition, elongation, and growth-terminating zone). Differential gene expression in each was compared.Results: Both microarrays and RNA-Seq proved applicable to the small samples. A total of 4180 genes were differentially expressed (with fold changes of 2 or greater) between Zone 1 and Zone 2. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel transcriptionally active regions were identified by RNA-Seq that were not detected in microarrays. However, microarrays detected spaceflight-relevant genes that were missed in RNA-Seq. Discussion: Single root tip subsections can be used for transcriptome analysis using either RNA-Seq or microarrays. Both RNA-Seq and microarrays provided novel information. These data suggest that techniques for dealing with small, rare samples from spaceflight can be further enhanced, and that RNA-Seq may miss some spaceflight-relevant changes in gene expression.",Tissue,"transcription profiling

OSD-209,Re-Adaption on Earth after Spaceflights Affects the Mouse Liver Proteome,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Harsh environmental conditions including microgravity and radiation during prolonged spaceflights are known to alter hepatic metabolism. Our studies have focused on the analysis of possible changes in metabolic pathways in livers of mice which experienced 30 days of spaceflight with and without an additional re-adaption period of 7 days compared to control mice on Earth. Utilizing shotgun mass spectrometry and label-free quantification, we performed proteomic profiling to investigate mice livers from the spaceflight project ‚ÄúBion-M 1‚Äù. No significant alterations in protein levels were observed between control mice liver and spaceflight mice which is possibly caused by insufficient fold change detection combined with high variances within the groups. In contrast, our results show that more than a third of the quantified protein levels are altered comparing the liver proteome of mice with and without re-adaption time after their spaceflight. Proteins related to amino acid metabolism showed higher levels after re-adaption, which may indicate higher rates of gluconeogenesis. Members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway reconstitute their level after 7 days due to a decrease in fold change, which indicates decreased signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Moreover, bile acid secretion regenerates on Earth due to reconstitution of related transmembrane proteins and elevated levels of the drug-metabolising enzymes belonging to the CYP superfamily decrease 7 days after the spaceflight. Thus, our study demonstrates reconstitution of pharmacological response and early signs of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recover within 7 days, whereas glucose uptake should be monitored due to alterations in gluconeogenesis.","Spaceflight

APEX03-2 (Advanced Plant Experiment 03-2), also known as TAGES-ISA (Transgenic Arabidopsis Gene Expression System-Intracellular Signaling Architecture) specifically addresses the growth and molecular changes that occur in Arabidopsis thaliana plants during spaceflight by using molecular and genetic tools, and by asking fundamental questions regarding root structure, growth and cell wall remodeling may be answered. This investigation advances the fundamental understanding of the molecular biological responses to extraterrestrial environments. This understanding helps to further define the impacts of spaceflight on biological systems to better enable NASA's future space exploration goals.","Spaceflight

The objective of our spaceflight experiment ‚ÄúPlant Signaling in Microgravity‚Äù (carried out on the International Space Station, ISS), was to compare transcript profiles of wild type and transgenic InsP 5-ptase plants with compromised InsP3 signaling. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants constitutively express the mammalian type I inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (InsP 5-ptase), an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes the lipid-derived second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3). These transgenic plants exhibit normal growth and morphology; however, their responses to environmental stimuli including gravity and drought are altered. Seedlings were grown for 5 days under continuous light in experimental containers placed in the European Modular Cultivation system (EMCS) onboard the ISS. The EMCS consists of two rotors within a controlled chamber, allowing for a ‚Äú1g‚Äù control in space. After sample retrieval from the ISS, RNA was isolated from shoot and root tissue and subjected to RNA sequencing. Two-way comparisons of micro g versus ‚Äú1‚Äùg have uncovered regulatory mechanisms that are both conserved and altered between the wild type and transgenic seedlings.","Spaceflight

The investigation included the A. nidulans wild-type and three mutant strains, two of which were genetically engineered to enhance secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed that ISS conditions altered the A. nidulans genome in specific regions. In strain CW12001, which features overexpression of the secondary metabolite global regulator laeA, ISS conditions induced the loss of the laeA stop codon. Differential expression of proteins involved in stress response, carbohydrate metabolic processes, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis was also observed. ISS conditions significantly decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in LO1362 and CW12001, which are deficient in a major DNA repair mechanism.

To this end, a flight group (FLT) of 10-week-old male C57BL/6J mice was launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on 8/14/2017 and housed in Rodent Habitats on the ISS for 33 days before being returned alive to Earth. After splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the animals were transported to Loma Linda University (LLU) for testing, euthanasia and dissection on 9/18/2018. A Basal Control (BSL) was housed in standard cages at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and euthanized one day after launch of the FLT animals (8/15/2017). Ground Control (GC) and Vivarium Control (VIV) studies were planned to commence at KSC approximately one-week after the conclusion of the flight experiments. However, all the GC and VIV mouse studies at KSC had to be cancelled due to Hurricane Irma and potential adverse effects on the animal housing facility. The GC and VIV studies were therefore rescheduled and begun in May, 2018. The GC was euthanized and dissected 6/18/2018 - 6/20/2018, while the VIV was euthanized and dissected 6/22/2018 - 6/23/2018. Because this resulted in a different cohort of mice being used for the GC and VIV controls as compared to the flight (FLT) and basal (BSL) groups, two cohort controls were included in the study. The first, Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1), was from the same cohort as the FLT and BSL animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 4 days after the FLT group (9/22/2017). The second, Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2), was from the same cohort as the GC and VIV animals, and was sacrificed and dissected 2-8 days after the GC and VIV groups, (6/24/2018 - 6/26/2018). The CC_C1 and CC_C2 groups were housed in standard cages and fed standard chow in contrast to all other groups which received Rodent Foodbars. To clarify the connections between treatment groups and animal cohorts, the following group abbreviations are used in the sample metadata: Flight (FLT_C1); Basal (BSL_C1); Ground Control (GC_C2); Vivarium Control (VIV_C2), Cohort Control 1 (CC_C1); Cohort Control 2 (CC_C2). Fecal pellets were isolated directly from mice during dissection and preserved by flash freezing in liquid nitrogen before stored at -80 C. DNA was then extracted, shotgun metagenomic libraries generated, and libraries sequenced (target 10 M clusters at PE 250 bp). Metagenomic data was generated from the following groups: Basal Control (n=5), Ground Control (n=5), Vivarium Control (n=5), Cohort Control 1 (n=5), Cohort Control 2 (n=5), Flight (n=5).",Spaceflight,Metagenomic sequencing,SpaceX-12,Rodent Habitat,10.26030/rj1y-dq03

We utilized human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to study the effects of microgravity on cell-level cardiac function and gene expression. The hiPSC-CMs were cultured aboard the ISS for 5.5 weeks and their gene expression, structure, and functions were compared to ground control hiPSC-CMs. Exposure to microgravity on the ISS caused alterations in hiPSC-CM calcium handling. RNA-sequencing analysis demonstrated 2,635 genes were differentially expressed among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, including genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. This study represents the first use of hiPSCs to model the effects of spaceflight on human cardiomyocyte structure and function.","Spaceflight

Vegetative cells of the first passage were processed and subjected to quantitative proteomics using tandem mass tags. Approximately 60% of all proteins encoded by SAFR-032 were identified, and 301 proteins were differentially expressed among the strains. We found that proteins predicted to be involved in carbohydrate transport/metabolism and energy production/conversion had lower abundance than those of the ground control. For three proteins, we showed that the expected metabolic activities were decreased, as expected with direct enzymatic assays. This was consistent with a decrease of ATP production in the space-surviving strains. The same space-surviving strains showed increased abundance of proteins related to survival, growth advantage, and stress response. Such alterations in the proteomes provide insights into possible molecular mechanisms of B. pumilus SAFR-032 to adapt to and resist extreme extraterrestrial environments.","Spaceflight

Genomic analyses using EF-1Œ± sequences, presence/absence of effector proteins, k-mer comparisons, and single nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that these two strains are genomically different from 65 known sequenced strains. Functional analysis revealed that ISS-F3/F4 had higher relative abundances of polyketide synthase domains than a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate, used for biocontrol properties (Fo47), and a clinical isolate (FOSC-3a). Putative secondary metabolite analysis indicates that ISS-F3/F4 may produce yet-unreported polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. While genomic analysis showed that these ISS strains are unlikely to be plant pathogens, a virulence assay using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model of fusariosis revealed that they were virulent and may represent opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans.

The experiment was conducted with ground control conditions similar to those actually used in spaceflight. Cultures were limited in growth rate due to gas permeable membranes to provide oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange and a lack of agitation to mix the cells throughout the liquid media. Two strains were grown and three biological replicates were completed for each strain. Specific variables (factors) tested were: 1) The effect of UVC (short-wave ultraviolet light) mutagenesis was tested by sampling the algae cultures prior to mutagenesis. 2) The sensitivity of different strains was tested by conducting the experiment with a wild-type and cell wall mutant (cw15) strain. 3) The effect of competitive growth was tested by sampling each biological replicate experiment at the end of each growth cycle. 4) The effect of live culture storage in the dark was tested by sampling each growth cycle twice. At the time of passage, a sample of cells was pelleted and frozen. The cultures were then stored in the dark in a Cargo Transport Bag (CTB) to simulate storage on the ISS and return of cultures. This factor tested whether cultures could be stored alive in the dark or if samples needed to be fixed at the time of passage in order to get an accurate representation of the genetic variation in each cycle of growth.

Twenty BALB/c, 12-weeks old female mice (ten controls and ten treated) were flown to the ISS and housed in the Rodent Habitat for 39-42 days. Twenty mice of similar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Spatially resolved transcriptional profiles were generated from hearts from three flight and three ground control animals as follows. Hearts were cryosectioned longitudinally onto an array of capture probes that bind RNA, fixed, stained and visualized. Heart sections were then permeabilized to release RNA onto the capture probes, and cDNA synthesized on the chip so that its spatial arrangement is encoded within a set of molecular barcodes. cDNA was then released and sequenced. Four to five levels of each heart was analyzed in this manner to allow a 3D reconstruction of the transcriptome. In addition, bulk RNA-seq (ribodepleted, target depth of 60 M clusters, PE 150 bp) was performed from a pool of RNA extracted from 10-20 sections from each of 3 flight and 2 ground control samples.",Spaceflight,"transcription profiling

Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium",Ground Study,"Physical forces associated with spaceflight and spaceflight analogue culture regulate a wide range of physiological responses by both bacterial and mammalian cells that can impact infection. However, our mechanistic understanding of how these environments regulate host-pathogen interactions in humans is poorly understood. Using a spaceflight analogue low fluid shear culture system, we investigated the effect of Low Shear Modeled Microgravity (LSMMG) culture on the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in a 3-D biomimetic model of human colonic epithelium containing macrophages. RNA-seq profiling of stationary phase wild type and delta hfq mutant bacteria alone indicated that LSMMG culture induced global changes in gene expression in both strains and that the RNA-binding protein Hfq played a significant role in regulating the transcriptional response of the pathogen to LSMMG culture. However, a core set of genes important for adhesion, invasion, and motility were commonly induced in both strains. LSMMG culture enhanced the colonization (adherence, invasion and intracellular survival) of Salmonella in this advanced model of intestinal epithelium using a mechanism that was independent of Hfq. Although S. Typhimurium delta hfq mutants are normally defective for invasion when grown as conventional shaking cultures, LSMMG conditions unexpectedly enabled high levels of colonization by an isogenic hfq mutant. In response to infection with either the wild type or mutant, host cells upregulated transcripts involved in inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound healing during intracellular survival. Interestingly, infection by the hfq mutant led to fewer transcriptional differences between LSMMG- and control-infected host cells relative to infection with the wild type strain. This is the first study to investigate the effect of LSMMG culture on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and a 3-D model of human intestinal tissue. These findings advance our understanding of how physical forces can impact the early stages of human enteric salmonellosis.","Genotype

OSD-278,Spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions increase virulence of Serratia marcescens in the Drosophila melanogaster infection model,Drosophila melanogaster,Spaceflight Study,"While it has been shown that astronauts suffer immune disorders after spaceflight, the underlying causes are still poorly understood and there are many variables to consider when investigating the immune system in a complex environment. Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are significantly influenced by spaceflight and ground-based spaceflight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was significantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but that the host immune system is not significantly altered amongst known immune genes. High-throughput sequencing of wild-type (w1118) adult hosts infected with either space or ground-reared S. marcescens revealed few changes in gene expression, with 11 genes significantly differentially expressed (q-values <0.05) and only one gene related to the immune system. This data supports the main findings of the paper, which state that both spaceflight and low-shear modeled microgravity conditions increase the virulence of this pathogen, independent of the host immune system. This data, which shows that there are no significant immune-related changes to the host when infected with space-grown sample compared to ground-grown sample, provides further evidence that there are likely phenotypic changes to the pathogen itself that is causing increased virulence in spaceflight and in low-shear modeled microgravity. RNA was extracted in triplicate from 2 pooled adult (2-3 day old female) Drosophila melanogaster (w1118) per treatment, with 4 total treatment groups (no injection control, sham injection with PBS, ground bacteria-injected, and space bacteria-injected) with poly(A)+ RNA libraries.

The Sku5 gene (AT4G12420) codes for a multi-copper oxidase-like protein SKU5 protein that is involved in directed root tip growth. The Sku5 protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored and localizes to the plasma membrane and the cell wall. The Sku5 gene is expressed most strongly in expanding tissues. The development of WS and Sku5 plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. However the development of Sku5 mutant plants also differs from WS at either age and in either environment, suggesting the role of the genetic background in these developmental decisions. The 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit engaged substantially more genes than the 4 days old WS roots in orbit but also more than the 4 days old Sku5 roots on the ground. Overall the 4 days old roots differentially expressed more genes in spaceflight relative to ground than the 8 days old roots of either genotype. Finally, the 4 days old Sku5 roots in orbit differ in 862 genes from the 8 days Sku5 roots in orbit while on the ground there is merely half of the number of genes differentially expressed between the 4 days and 8 days developmental stages of the Sku5 roots.

OSD-294,Efficient Identification of Multiple Pathways: RNA-Seq Analysis of Livers from 56Fe Ion Irradiated Mice,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Background: mRNA interactions with each other and other signaling molecules define different biological pathways and functions. Researchers have been investigating various tools to analyze these types of interactions. In particular, gene co-expression network methods have proved useful in finding and analyzing these molecular interactions. Many different analytical pipelines to identify these interactions networks have been proposed with the aim of identifying an optimal partition of the network where the individual modules are neither too small to make any general inference or too large to be biologically interpretable. Results: In this study, we propose a new pipeline to perform gene co-expression network analysis. The proposed pipeline uses WGCNA, a widely used software to perform different aspects of gene co-expression network analysis and modularity maximization algorithm to analyze novel RNA-Seq data to understand the effects of low-dose 56Fe ion irradiation on the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice. The network results along with experimental validation show that using WGCNA combined with Modularity provide a more biologically interpretable network in our dataset. Our pipeline showed better performance than the existing clustering algorithm in WGCNA in finding modules and identified a module with mitochondrial subunits that are supported by mitochondrial complex assay. Conclusions: We present a pipeline that can reduce the problem of parameter selection with the existing algorithm in WGCNA for comparable RNA-Seq datasets which may assist in future research to discover novel mRNA interactions and their downstream molecular effects. C57BL16 males were placed into 2 treatment groups and received the following irradiation treatments at Brookhaven National Laboratories (Long Island, NY): 600 MeV/n 56Fe (0.2 Gy), and no irradiation. Left liver lobes were collected at 30, 60, 120, 270, and 360 days post-irradiation, flash frozen and stored at -80¬∞C until they could be processed for RNA-Seq. Livers were sampled by taking two 40-micron thick slices using a cryotome at -20¬∞C. This allowed multiple sampling of the tissue without the tissue going through multiple freeze/thaw cycles. Total RNA was isolated from the liver slices using RNAqueousTM Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and rRNA was removed via Ribo-ZeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) prior to library preparation with the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library kit. Samples were sequenced in a paired-end 50 base format on an Illumina HiSeq 1500. Reads were aligned to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome using the STAR alignment program, version 2.5.3a, with the recommended ENCODE options. The -quantMode GeneCounts option was used to obtain read counts per gene based on the Gencode release M14 annotation file. Total number of reads used in analysis varies between 23-35 millions of reads.","Ionizing Radiation

Here we investigated the physiological and molecular mechanisms underpinning the spaceflight effects on dry seeds. We found that 'Space' seed germination vigor was reduced and aging sensitivity increased, but the spaceflight did not compromise seed viability and the development of normal seedlings. Comparative analysis of the transcriptomes (using RNASeq) in dry seeds and upon controlled artificial aging treatment (CAAT) revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with spaceflight and ageing. DEG categories enriched by spaceflight and CAAT included transcription and translation with reduced transcript abundances for 40S and 60S ribosomal subunit genes. Among the 'spaceflight-up' DEGs were Heat Shock Protein (HSP), DNAJ-related chaperones, a Heat Shock Factor (HSFA7a-like), and components of several DNA repair pathways (e.g. ATM, DNA ligase1). The 'response to radiation' category was especially enriched in 'spaceflight-up' DEGs including HSPs, catalases and the transcription factor HY5. The major finding from the physiological and transcriptome analysis is that spaceflight causes vigor loss and partial ageing during air-dry seed storage, for which space environmental factors and consequences for seed storage during spaceflights are discussed.","Spaceflight

OSD-304,Global gene expression in response to X rays in mice deficient in Parp1,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"There is a current interest in the development of biodosimetric methods for rapidly assessing radiation exposure in the wake of a large-scale radiological event. The initial focus of this work has largely centered on determining the exposure dose to an individual using biological indicators. Gene expression signatures are showing promise for biodosimetric application, but little is known about how these signatures might translate for the assessment of radiological injury in radiosensitive individuals, who comprise a significant fraction of the general population, and who would likely require treatment following lower doses. Using Parp1-/- mice as a model radiation sensitive genotype, we have investigated the effect of this DNA repair deficiency on the gene expression response to radiation. Although Parp1 is known to play general roles in regulating transcription, the pattern of gene expression changes observed 24 h after exposure to a potentially lethal LD50 dose of radiation was remarkably similar in the two genotypes, and indicated similar levels of activation of both the p53 and NFŒ∫B radiation response pathways. In contrast, exposure of wild-type mice to a sub-lethal dose that was equal to the LD50 dose given to the Parp1-/- mice, resulted in a reduced gene expression response. Gene expression classifiers trained on the wild-type data correctly identified all wild-type samples as unexposed, exposed to a sub-lethal dose, or exposed to a potentially lethal dose. All unexposed samples from the Parp1-/- mice were also correctly classified, and 80% of the irradiated samples were identified as exposed to a potentially lethal dose. The results of this study suggest that, at least for some genotypes, gene expression has the potential to accurately detect the extent of radiological injury, rather than being useful only as a surrogate of physical radiation dose.","Ionizing Radiation

To probe the response of its transcriptome to this extreme environment, S. liquefaciens ATCC 27592 was cultivated under 4 different environmental simulations: 0C, 0.7 kPa, CO2 atmosphere (Condition A); 0C, ~101.3 kPa, CO2 atmosphere (Condition B); 0C, ~101.3 kPa, ambient N2/O2 atmosphere (Condition C); and 30C, ~101.3 kPa, N2/O2 atmosphere (Condition D; ambient laboratory conditions). RNA-seq was performed on ribosomal RNA-depleted total RNA isolated from triplicate cultures grown under Conditions A-D and the datasets generated were subjected to transcriptome analyses. The data from Conditions A, B, or C were compared to laboratory Condition D. Significantly differentially expressed transcripts were identified belonging to a number of KEGG pathway categories. Up-regulated genes under all Conditions A, B, and C included those encoding transporters (ABC and PTS transporters); genes involved in translation (ribosomes and their biogenesis, biosynthesis of both tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNAs); DNA repair and recombination; and non-coding RNAs. Genes down-regulated under all Conditions A, B, and C included: transporters (mostly ABC transporters); flagellar and motility proteins; genes involved in phenylalanine metabolism; transcription factors; and two-component systems. The results are discussed in the context of Mars astrobiology and planetary protection.","Temperature

OSD-307,Evaluating the Lettuce Metatranscriptome with MinION Sequencing for Future Spaceflight Food Production Application,Microbiota,Ground Study,"Healthy plants are vital for successful, long-duration missions in space, as they provide the crew with life support, food production, and psychological benefits. The microorganisms that associate with plant tissues play a critical role in improving plant growth, health, and production. To that end, it is necessary to develop methodologies that investigate the metabolic activities of the plant‚Äôs microbiome in orbit to enable rapid responses regarding the care of plants in space. In this study, we developed a protocol to characterize the endophytic and epiphytic microbial metatranscriptome of red romaine lettuce, a key salad crop that was grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions. Microbial transcripts enriched from host-microbe total RNA were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. Results showed that this enrichment approach was highly reproducible and effective for rapid on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. Taxonomic analysis based on 16S and 18S rRNA transcripts identified that the top five most abundant phyla in the lettuce microbiome were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Ascomycota. The metatranscriptomic analysis identified the expression of genes involved in many metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and signal transduction. Network analyses of the expression data show that, within the signal transduction pathway of the fungal community, the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase signaling pathway was tightly regulated across all samples and could be a potential driver for fungal proliferation. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of using MinION-based metatranscriptomics of enriched microbial RNA as a method for rapid, on-site monitoring of the transcriptional activity of crop microbiomes, thereby helping to facilitate and maintain plant health for on-orbit space food production.","Relative Humidity

MAT is increased in rodents during spaceflight but a causal relationship between MAT and bone loss remains unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of a 14-day spaceflight on bone mass, bone resorption, bone formation, and MAT in lumbar vertebrae of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Twelve-week-old OVX Fischer 344 rats were randomly assigned to a ground control or flight group. Following flight, histological sections of the second lumbar vertebrae (n equals 11/group) were stained using a technique that allowed simultaneous quantification of cells and preflight fluorochrome label. Compared with ground controls, rats flown in space had 32% lower cancellous bone area and 306% higher MAT. The increased adiposity was due to an increase in adipocyte number (224%) and size (26%). Mineral apposition rate and osteoblast turnover were unchanged during spaceflight. In contrast, resorption of a preflight fluorochrome and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were increased (16% and 229%, respectively). The present findings indicate that cancellous bone loss in rat lumbar vertebrae during spaceflight is accompanied by increased bone resorption and MAT but no change in bone formation. These findings do not support the hypothesis that increased MAT during spaceflight reduces osteoblast activity or lifespan. However, in the context of ovarian hormone deficiency, bone formation during spaceflight was insufficient to balance increased resorption, indicating defective coupling. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that during spaceflight mesenchymal stem cells are diverted to adipocytes at the expense of forming osteoblasts. This dataset derives results from the bone histomorphometry assay.",Spaceflight,Histological Assay,STS-62,Animal Enclosure Module (AEM),10.26030/kb2k-2150

Spaceflight produce deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, we have used mutants from the two nucleolin genes in Arabidopsis (NUC1 and NUC2), encoding the main regulator of the ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus, in order to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, while nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments will determine the basis for the identification of a genetic background enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.","Genotype

OSD-314,Adaptive response of Arabidopsis seedlings in microgravity and Mars reduced gravity environment is enhanced by red light photostimulation,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"The response of plants to the spaceflight environment and microgravity is still not well understood, although there has been an increased emphasis on this topic. Even less is known about plants' response to partial or reduced gravity levels. In the absence of the directional cues provided by the gravity vector, the plant is especially perceptive to other cues such as light. Here, we investigate the response of Arabidopsis thaliana 6-day-old seedlings to microgravity and the Mars partial gravity level during spaceflight, as well as the effects of red light photostimulation by determining meristematic cell growth and proliferation. These experiments involve microscopic techniques together with transcriptomic studies. We demonstrate that microgravity and partial gravity trigger differential responses. The microgravity environment activates hormonal routes responsible for proliferation/growth and upregulates plastid/mitochondrial-encoded transcripts, even in the dark. In contrast, the Mars gravity level inhibits these routes and activates responses to stress factors to restore cell growth parameters only when red photostimulation is provided. This response is accompanied by upregulation of numerous transcription factors such as the environmental acclimation-related WRKY family. In the long term, these discoveries can be applied in the design of bioregenerative life support systems and space farming.","Spaceflight

Despite its crucial role in host protection, effects on the human antibody repertoire are unknown. Consequently, we examined the IgM repertoire of five cosmonauts 25 days before launch, after 64 and 129 days spent on the International Space Station (ISS), and after 1, 7 and 30 days of Earth reambulation using high-throughput sequencing. This is the first study of this kind. Our data revealed that the IgM repertoire of cosmonauts was different from the one of control subjects already prior to launch, and that 2 out the 5 analyzed cosmonauts presented significant changes of their IgM repertoire during the mission. These modifications persisted up to 30 days after landing, likely affected the specificities of IgM binding sites, correlated with changes of the V(D)J recombination process in charge of creating functional antibody genes, and coincided with a higher stress response. These data confirm that about half of the astronauts who spent six months on the ISS are subjected to immunological changes, contribute to explain increased susceptibility to infection, reveal individual responses and consequently that personalized approaches should be implemented during future deep-space exploration missions that will endure for an unprecedented amount of time.","Spaceflight

OSD-317,Galactic cosmic radiation induces stable epigenome alterations relevant to human lung cancer,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Human deep space and planetary travel is limited by uncertainties regarding the health risks associated with exposure to galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), and in particular the high linear energy transfer (LET), heavy ion component. Here we assessed the impact of two high-LET ions 56Fe and 28Si, and low-LET X rays on genome-wide methylation patterns in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that all three radiation types induced rapid and stable changes in DNA methylation but at distinct subsets of CpG sites affecting different chromatin compartments. The 56Fe ions induced mostly hypermethylation, and primarily affected sites in open chromatin regions including enhancers, promoters and edges ('shores') of CpG islands. The 28Si ion-exposure had mixed effects, inducing both hyper and hypomethylation and affecting sites in more repressed heterochromatic environments, whereas X rays induced mostly hypomethylation, primarily at sites in gene bodies and intergenic regions. Significantly, the methylation status of 56Fe ion irradiation sensitive sites, but not those affected by X ray or 28Si ions, could discriminate tumor from normal tissue for human lung adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, high LET radiation exposure leaves a lasting imprint on the epigenome, and affects sites relevant to human lung cancer. The 56Fe ion signature may prove useful in monitoring the cumulative biological impact and associated cancer risks encountered by astronauts in deep space. Genome wide DNA methylation profiling of normal human bronchial epithelial cells irradiated with varying doses of 28Si-ion radiation ( 300 MeV/u at 0, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) , 56Fe-ion radiation (600 MeV/u at 0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0 Gy) or X rays (320 kV at 0, 1.0 Gy).

OSD-320,Gamma radiation and HZE treatment of seedlings in Arabidopsis,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Plants exhibit a robust transcriptional response to gamma radiation which includes the induction of transcripts required for homologous recombination and the suppression of transcripts that promote cell cycle progression. Various DNA damaging agents induce different spectra of DNA damage as well as 'collateral' damage to other cellular components and therefore are not expected to provoke identical responses by the cell. Here we study the effects of two different types of ionizing radiation (IR) treatment, HZE (1 GeV Fe26+ high mass, high charge, and high energy relativistic particles) and gamma photons, on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Both types of IR induce small clusters of radicals that can result in the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), but HZE also produces linear arrays of extremely clustered damage. We performed these experiments across a range of time points (1.5-24 h after irradiation) in both wild-type plants and in mutants defective in the DSB-sensing protein kinase ATM. The two types of IR exhibit a shared double strand break-repair-related damage response, although they differ slightly in the timing, degree, and ATM-dependence of the response. The ATM-dependent, DNA metabolism-related transcripts of the 'DSB response' were also induced by other DNA damaging agents, but were not induced by conventional stresses. Both Gamma and HZE irradiation induced, at 24 h post-irradiation, ATM-dependent transcripts associated with a variety of conventional stresses; these were overrepresented for pathogen response, rather than DNA metabolism. In contrast, only HZE-irradiated plants, at 1.5 h after irradiation, exhibited an additional and very extensive transcriptional response, shared with plants experiencing 'extended night.'

To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.","Spaceflight

C3H/HeNCrl mice were subjected to total body irradiation to simulate space HZE-irradiation environment and liver tissues were extracted at five different time points post-irradiation to investigate the time-dependent gradual carcinogenic response at the transcriptomic level. Our data demonstrated a clear difference in the effects of these HZE ions, particularly immunological, on the carcinogenic process of HCC, suggesting different molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Also seen in this study was novel unmapped transcripts that were significantly affected by HZE. To investigate the biological functions of these transcripts, we used a machine learning technique known as self-organizing maps (SOMs) to characterize the transcriptome expression profiles of 60 samples (45 HZE-irradiated, 15 non-irradiated control) from liver tissues. A handful of localized modules in the maps emerged as groups of co-regulated and co-expressed transcripts. The functional context of these modules was discovered using overrepresentation analysis. We found that these spots typically contained enriched populations of transcripts related to specific immunological molecular processes. Taken together, these findings not only led to a better understanding of biological mechanisms underlying risks for HCC after HZE irradiation but also have important implications for discovery of potential countermeasures and identification of biomarkers of HZE-induced HCC.","Ionizing Radiation

However, the influence of this environment on host-pathogen interactions remains poorly understood. Here we report our results from the STL-IMMUNE study flown aboard Space Shuttle mission STS-131, which investigated multi-omic responses (transcriptomic, proteomic) of human intestinal epithelial cells to infection with Salmonella Typhimurium when both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight. To our knowledge, this was the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells. Additionally, it is the first global transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of human intestinal epithelial cultures during spaceflight (either infected or uninfected).","Spaceflight

Growing evidence suggests that osteocytes, the most abundant cells in the mineralized bone matrix, play a key role in sensing mechanical forces applied to the skeleton and in transducing them into subcellular biochemical signals to modulate bone homeostasis. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying both mechanosensation and mechanotransduction in osteocytes under the real microgravity (¬µG) condition are poorly understood. To unravel the mechanisms by which osteocyte, sense and responds to mechanical unloading, we exposed murine osteocytic cell line, Ocy454, seeded on a highly porous polystyrene 3D scaffold, to 2, 4, or 6 days of ¬µG on board the International Space Station (ISS) and compared their gene expression with cells at 1G on Earth. Bioinformatics analysis of cells exposed to ¬µG revealed several pathways differentially regulated upon exposure to microgravity.","Spaceflight

Under the Rodent Research Program of NASA, we assayed the genomic and metabolomics perturbations in the quadriceps of C57BL/6J male mice that lived on the spaceflight (FLT) or at Ground Control (CTR) for approximately four weeks. Wet weight of quadriceps were significantly reduced in FLT mice. Deep next generation sequencing and untargeted mass spectroscopic assay interrogated the gene-metabolite landscape of same tissues. A majority of top ranked differentially suppressed genes in FLT encode proteins from myosin or troponin family suggesting a sarcomere alteration in space. Significantly enriched gene-metabolite networks were found linked to saromeric integrity, immune fitness and oxidative stress response; all inhibited in space as per in silico prediction. A significant loss of FLT mitochondrial DNA copy numbers underlined the energy deprivation associated with spaceflight induced stress, and this hypothesis was reinforced by the omics analysis that showed inhibited networks related to protein, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. Finally, we reported a list of upstream regulators, which could be targeted for next generation therapeutic intervention for the betterment of the musculoskeletal system in male mice subjected to chronic disuse.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,SpaceX-10,Rodent Habitat,10.26030/rmv6-a863

Roots of wt (4d), atm (3d) and atr (4d) mutants have been analyzed after a 1h irradiation. Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), encodes a large protein with a phosph@idylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like domain at the C terminus (reviewed by Rotman and Shiloh, 1998). PI3K-related proteins make up a large family of Ser-Thr protein kinases, numerous members of which are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, responses to DNA damage, and the maintenance of genomic stability (Hoekstra, 1997). AtATM plays an essential role in meiosis and in the somatic response to DNA damage in plants, similar to the function of ATM in mammals and other eukaryotes. Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) plays a central role in cell-cycle regulation, transmitting DNA damage signals to downstream effectors of cell-cycle progression.","Genotype

In this connection, cardiovascular adaptation in low gravity is a critical component of human space exploration. Deep high-throughput sequencing approach allowed us to analyze the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), cultured under gravity (G), and stimulated microgravity (MG) achieved with a clinostat. The present study identified totally 1870 miRNAs differentially expressed in HUVEC under MG condition when compared to the cells subjected to unitary G conditions. The functional association of identified miRNAs targeting specific mRNAs revealed that miRNAs, hsa-mir-496, hsa-mir-151a, hsa-miR-296-3p, hsa-mir-148a, hsa-miR-365b-5p, hsa-miR-3687, hsa-mir-454, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-145-5p differentially regulated the genes involved in cell adhesion, angiogenesis, cell cycle, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling, nitric oxide signaling, VEGF signaling, and wound healing pathways. Further, the q-PCR based experimental studies of upregulated and downregulated miRNA and mRNAs demonstrate that the above reported miRNAs influence the cell proliferation and vascular functions of the HUVEC in MG conditions effectively. Consensus on the interactome results indicates restricted fluctuations in the transcriptome of the HUVEC exposed to short-term MG that could lead to higher levels of endothelial functions like angiogenesis and vascular patterning.",Microgravity Simulation,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/09xz-fy91

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are particularly susceptible to genotoxic stress, and accumulation of damage can lead to HSC dysfunction and oncogenesis. Our group recently demonstrated that aging human HSCs accumulate microsatellite instability coincident with loss of MLH1, a DNA Mismatch Repair (MMR) protein, which could reasonably predispose to radiation-induced HSC malignancies. Therefore, in an effort to reduce risk uncertainty for cancer development during deep space travel, we employed an Mlh1+/- mouse model to study the effects high-LET 56Fe ion space-like radiation. Irradiated Mlh1+/- mice showed a significantly higher incidence of lymphomagenesis with 56Fe ions compared to √é¬≥-rays and unirradiated mice, and malignancy correlated with increased MSI in the tumors. In addition, whole-exome sequencing analysis revealed high SNVs and INDELs in lymphomas being driven by loss of Mlh1 and frequently mutated genes had a strong correlation with human leukemias. Therefore, the data suggest that age-related MMR deficiencies could lead to HSC malignancies after space radiation, and that countermeasure strategies will be required to adequately protect the astronaut population on the journey to Mars.","Genotype

OSD-342,Targeting myostatin/activin A protects against skeletal muscle and bone loss during spaceflight [plasma proteomics],Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Among the physiological consequences of extended spaceflight are loss of skeletal muscle and bone mass. One signaling pathway that plays an important role in maintaining muscle and bone homeostasis is that regulated by the secreted signaling proteins, myostatin (MSTN) and activin A. Here, we used both genetic and pharmacological approaches to investigate the effect of targeting MSTN/activin A signaling in mice that were sent to the International Space Station. Wild type mice lost significant muscle and bone mass during the 33 d spent in microgravity. Muscle weights of Mstn -/- mice, which are about twice those of wild type mice, were largely maintained during spaceflight. Systemic inhibition of MSTN/activin A signaling using a soluble form of the activin type IIB receptor (ACVR2B), which can bind each of these ligands, led to dramatic increases in both muscle and bone mass, with effects being comparable in ground and flight mice. Exposure to microgravity and treatment with the soluble receptor each led to alterations in numerous signaling pathways, which were reflected in changes in levels of key signaling components in the blood as well as their RNA expression levels in muscle and bone. These findings have implications for therapeutic strategies to combat the concomitant muscle and bone loss occurring in people afflicted with disuse atrophy on Earth as well as in astronauts in space, especially during prolonged missions.","Spaceflight

Our data revealed that adverse effects on B lymphopoiesis were more marked one week after landing and that this phenomenon was associated with a 41% reduction of B cells in the spleen. Thus, the effects of spaceflight persisted during at least one week after landing.

Additional ground-based ovary-intact rats provided age-matched reference values at baseline (n equals 8) and landing (n equals 10). Ovariectomy resulted in bone- and bone compartment-specific deficits in cancellous bone volume fraction. Spaceflight resulted in lower cortical bone accrual in the femur but had no effect on cortical bone in the humerus or calvarium. Cancellous bone volume fraction was lower in flight animals compared to ground control animals in lumbar vertebra and distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis; significant differences were not detected in the distal humerus. Bone loss (compared to baseline controls) in the femur metaphysis was associated with lower trabecular number, whereas trabecular thickness and number were lower in the epiphysis. This dataset is only for the ovariectomized animals. In summary, the effect of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture in ovariectomized rats was bone-and bone compartment-specific but not strictly related to weight bearing.

Twenty mice of similar age, and matching sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. Basal controls were housed in standard vivarium cages. Spaceflight, ground controls and basal groups had blood collected, then were euthanized, had one hind limb removed, and finally whole carcasses were stored at -80 C until dissection. All mice in this data set received only the control/sham injection. Brain samples from three flight and three ground control animal groups were cut in half between hemispheres. One hemisphere of each brain was used for generating spatially resolved transcriptional profiling data. Hemispheres were cryosectioned so that 2 consecutive sections from the hippocampus of each brain was placed on Visium Gene Expression arrays. Samples were fixed, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and imaged. Imaging was followed by tissue permeabilization to release mRNA molecules from cells for capture onto the array surface. Subsequently, following the 10XGenomics Visium Gene Expression protocol, Spatial Transcriptomics RNA-seq libraries were prepared and sequenced. The other hemisphere of each brain was used for single nuclei RNA-seq and ATAC-seq using the 10X Multiome protocol.

The probes were then summarized into groups (probe-sets) reflecting either an ensembl full transcript identifier (FL-ENST, GPL24047) or just the probes targeting the 3' UTR or the 5' UTR of that particular ENST. Therefore, 3 different CDF were used to process the HTA 2.0 arrays in this study. Note that each CEL file was GC adjusted using APT while our custom CDF pipeline removes any probe that has >80% or <20% GC content (~50,000). The analysis was carried out only on the pairs of probe-sets i.e. FL-ENST vs 3'UTR or FL-ENST vs 5'UTR or 3'UTR vs 5'UTR. Dynamic muscle loading alters tissue phenotype reflecting altered metabolic and functional demands. In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. We present a within-person analysis strategy that reduced heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ~40% and employed a genome-wide transcriptome method that modeled each mRNA from coding exons and 3‚Äô/5‚Äô untranslated (UTR) regions. Our strategy detected ~3-4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation that other methods would not detect. We discovered a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth validated from newly analyzed independent samples (n=100). Further validating these identified genes, via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis e.g. Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans MoTrPAC. Employing proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis revealed notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug-therapies.","Hindlimb Unloading

OSD-356,Euprymna scolopes Transcriptome or Gene expression,Vibrio fischeri,Ground Study,"For long-duration space missions, it is critical to maintain health-associated homeostasis between astronauts and their microbiome. To achieve this goal it is important to more fully understand the host‚Äìsymbiont relationship under the physiological stress conditions of spaceflight. To address this issue we examined the impact of a spaceflight analog, low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG), on the transcriptome of the mutualistic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. Cultures of V. fischeri and a mutant defective in the global regulator Hfq (‚àÜhfq) were exposed to either LSMMG or gravity conditions for 12‚Äâh (exponential growth) and 24‚Äâh (stationary phase growth). Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed few to no significant differentially expressed genes between gravity and the LSMMG conditions in the wild type or mutant V. fischeri at exponential or stationary phase. There was, however, a pronounced change in transcriptomic profiles during the transition between exponential and stationary phase growth in both V. fischeri cultures including an overall decrease in gene expression associated with translational activity and an increase in stress response. There were also several upregulated stress genes specific to the LSMMG condition during the transition to stationary phase growth. The ‚àÜhfq mutants exhibited a distinctive transcriptome profile with a significant increase in transcripts associated with flagellar synthesis and transcriptional regulators under LSMMG conditions compared to gravity controls. These results indicate the loss of Hfq significantly influences gene expression under LSMMG conditions in a bacterial symbiont. Together, these results improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which microgravity alters the physiology of beneficial host-associated microbes.","Genotype

Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Center, immediately after landing of the landing modules in the field (R0), and on the seventh day after landing as a part of medical examination (R+7). Semi-quantitative label-free proteomic analysis of 13 EBC samples collected from 5 Russian cosmonauts before and after long-term (169‚Äì199 days) spaceflights were performed and resulted in 164 different proteins. The highest number of proteins was detected in EBC after landing (R0).

OSD-360,Effects of low dose space radiation exposures on the splenic metabolome,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Future space missions will include return to the Moon and long duration deep space roundtrip missions to Mars. Leaving the protection that Low Earth Orbit provides will unavoidably expose astronauts to higher cumulative doses of space radiation, in addition to other stressors, e.g. microgravity. Immune regulation is known to be impacted and it remains to be seen whether prolonged effects will be encountered in deep space that can have an adverse impact on health. In this study we investigated the effects in overall metabolism of three different low dose radiation exposures (Œ≥-rays, 16O, and 56Fe) in spleen from male C57BL/6 mice at 1, 2, and 4 months after exposure. Forty metabolites were identified with significant enrichment in purine metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acids, acylcarnitines, and amino acids. Early perturbations were more prominent in the Œ≥ irradiated samples, while longer term responses shifted towards the high energy particle effects. Regression analysis showed a positive correlation of fatty acids with time and negative association with Œ≥-rays, while degradation of purines were positively associated with time. Taken together, there is a strong suggestion of mitochondrial implication and the possibility of long term effects in DNA repair and nucleotide pools following radiation exposure.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-362,An LaeA- and BrlA-Dependent Cellular Network Governs Tissue-Specific Secondary Metabolism in the Human Pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus,Aspergillus fumigatus,Ground Study,"Biosynthesis of many ecologically important secondary metabolites (SMs) in filamentous fungi is controlled by several global transcriptional regulators, like the chromatin modifier LaeA, and tied to both development and vegetative growth. In Aspergillus molds, asexual development is regulated by the BrlA  AbaA  WetA transcriptional cascade. To elucidate BrlA pathway involvement in SM regulation, we examined the transcriptional and metabolic profiles of ŒîbrlA, ŒîabaA, and ŒîwetA mutant and wild-type strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We find that BrlA, in addition to regulating production of developmental SMs, regulates vegetative SMs and the SrbA-regulated hypoxia stress response in a concordant fashion to LaeA. We further show that the transcriptional and metabolic equivalence of the ŒîbrlA and ŒîlaeA mutations is mediated by an LaeA requirement preventing heterochromatic marks in the brlA promoter. These results provide a framework for the cellular network regulating not only fungal SMs but diverse cellular processes linked to virulence of this pathogen. IMPORTANCE Filamentous fungi produce a spectacular variety of small molecules, commonly known as secondary or specialized metabolites (SMs), which are critical to their ecologies and lifestyles (e.g., penicillin, cyclosporine, and aflatoxin). Elucidation of the regulatory network that governs SM production is a major question of both fundamental and applied research relevance. To shed light on the relationship between regulation of development and regulation of secondary metabolism in filamentous fungi, we performed global transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses on mutant and wild-type strains of the human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus under conditions previously shown to induce the production of both vegetative growth-specific and asexual development-specific SMs. We find that the gene brlA, previously known as a master regulator of asexual development, is also a master regulator of secondary metabolism and other cellular processes. We further show that brlA regulation of SM is mediated by laeA, one of the master regulators of SM, providing a framework for the cellular network regulating not only fungal SMs but diverse cellular processes linked to virulence of this pathogen.","Strain

OSD-363,Inflammatory gene expression signatures in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: possible implications in microgravity-induced ICP elevation - CSF,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"The visual impairment and intracranial pressure (VIIP) syndrome is a neuro-ophthalmologic condition described in astronauts returning from long duration space missions. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri, is characterized by a chronic elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of an intracranial mass lesion. Because VIIP and IIH share some neurologic and ophthalmologic manifestations, the latter might be used as a model to study some of the processes underlying VIIP. This work constitutes a preliminary investigation of the molecular pathways associated with the elevation of ICP in IIH. Gene expression signatures were obtained from exosomes collected from CSF and plasma in patients with possible signs of IIH. The gene expression targets focused on inflammatory genes and miRNAs. The results suggest that inflammatory cytokine-driven processes and immune cell migration are activated when ICP is elevated in IIH patients, either as a cause or effect of the ICP increase. Several miRNAs appear to be involved in this response, among which miR-9 and miR-16 are upregulated in CSF and plasma of higher ICP subjects.

OSD-366,Coalescence of DNA double strand breaks induced by galactic cosmic radiation is modulated by genetics in 15 inbred strains of mice,Mus musculus,Ground Study,"This study analyzes the variability of responses to simulated deep space radiation among 15 commonly used mouse strains. Ex vivo primary skin fibroblast responses to high mass-high charge particles and X-rays were analyzed by quantifying DNA damage-sensing protein 53BP1 positive radiation-induced foci (RIF) as a surrogate biomarker of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Primary skin fibroblasts were isolated from 10 collaborative cross strains and five reference inbred mice (C57Bl/6, BALB/CByJ, B6C3, C3H and CBA/CaJ) and exposed to 350 MeV/n Ar and 600 MeV/n Fe particles as well as X-rays. Our results indicate that nearby DSBs coalesced into repair units characterized by large RIFs. Such model has the advantage of being much more efficient molecularly, but is poorly suited to deal with cosmic radiation, where energy is concentrated along the particle trajectory. Thus, we observed a large density of DSBs along each particle track and the percentage of unrepaired DSBs that increased with linear energy transfer of the particle over 48 hours post irradiation. Furthermore, persistent RIF levels ex vivo were well correlated with T and B lymphocyte survival in vivo in 10 collaborative cross strains 24 hours after 0.1 Gy whole-body dose of X-rays, suggesting that persistent RIFs might serve as an ex vivo biomarker for in vivo radiation toxicity. Finally, we performed genome-wide association study to identify the genomic associations with dose responses to ionizing radiation, marked as Foci per Gray (FPG), as well as with background DNA repair levels (BGD). This dataset includes GWAS data as well as FPG and BGD values for each sample and condition.","Strain

OSD-367,Bystander response to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles in a human 3-dimensional skin model in 16h after exposure to ionizing radiation,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Ionizing radiation (IR) not only affects cells that are directly irradiated but also their non-irradiated neighbors, which show responses known as bystander effects. While bystander and direct responses have several common end points including apoptosis and micronucleation, chromatin remodeling and altered levels or activities of regulatory proteins, they can be quantitatively and qualitatively different. The majority of studies of radiation bystander effects have utilized 2-dimensional in vitro systems, but we have recently demonstrated such effects in EPI-200 (Mat-Tek, Ashland, MA), a 3-dimensional tissue model that precisely imitates the structure and function of human epidermis. Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By exposing only a thin strip across the center of the EPI-200 tissue, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses in bystander cells located at 0.125 and 0.625 um from the irradiation line, in 16h after irradiation. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further network analysis was performed with IPA (Ingenuity). Significantly responding genes were identified at the both distances. For instance, all sets demonstrated upregulation of two key enzymes of the lipid biosynthesis, UGT1 and PITPNB, and downregulation of proapoptotic proteins: BAX and ARHGEF5. In contrast, several proteins involved in transcriptional repression (CHD6, CHD8 andWRNIP1) were strongly upregulated suggesting a rearrangement in the gene transcription. These changes suggest an activation of bystander mechanisms different from those observed in 2-dimensional cell cultures. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 16 hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles. Three independent experiments were performed for the samples collected at different distances from the irradiation line (125-625 and 625-1125 um) using three tissue fragments per a data point.","ionizing radiation

Unlike the traditional 2-dimensional in vitro systems, Epi-200 made of the primary cells, epidermal human keratinocytes. It mimics the structure of the human epidermis Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects. By comparing irradiated tissues with non-irradiated control, we have been able to measure global gene expression responses and reveal the affected biological pathways and molecular functions. The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis was performed with Panther database (Applied Biosystems). Gene ontology analysis of the samples harvested in 16h after exposure showed that irradiation presumably affected the genes involved in cell-cell signaling (15 genes, , p=9.0 x E-04) ion transport (10 genes, p=0.00189) and amino acid metabolism (5 genes, p=0.0258). Among 16 genes differentially expressed in 1h after exposure we found NOTCH2 (ENST00000401649) and methyltransferase AOF1 (KDM1B). In the mammalian cells, NOTCH signaling pathway has a role in differentiation and intracellular communication. Moreover the intercellular domain of NOTCH regulates gene expression acting as a transcription factor. In turn, AOF1 affects the transcription via histone demethylation. Thus, irradiation with alpha-particles caused predominant downregulation of multiple genes in 1 and 16h after exposure. It also suggested that changes in cell metabolism initially affected transcriptional regulation and finally led to the rearrangement in expression of genes playing a role in biosynthesis and ion trafficking. Radiation induced gene expression in 3-dimensional tissue model, Epi-200, was measured in 1 and 16 h hours after exposure to 0.5 Gy of alpha-particles.

Unlike the traditional 2-dimensional in vitro systems, Epi-200 made of the primary cells, epidermal human keratinocytes. It mimics the structure of the human epidermis Global gene expression is a powerful tool for uncovering both fundamental signaling processes and the mechanistic basis of cellular or physiological effects.

The data were analyzed using BRB-Array Tools (NIH), and further gene ontology analysis was performed with Panther (Applied Biosystems). The responding pathways were identified jointly and separately for up- and downregulated genes. Receptors (12 genes, p=0.0467), including nuclear hormone receptors (3 genes, p=8.2 x E-04) and Ser/Thr receptors (3 genes, p=5.3 x E-03), chemokines (2 genes, p=0.0155) and signaling molecules were overrepresented among 123 upregulated genes while DNA binding proteins (27 genes, p=5.07 x E-04), particularly helicases (6 genes, p=3.61 x E-03) and, G-protein modulators (16 genes, p=4.4 x E-03) were overrepresented among 403 downregulated genes. Remarkably, 6 differentially regulated genes in this group were represented by helicases and methyltransferases (6 genes, p=0. 0534) involved in methylation of histones and DNA. These changes confirmed an importance in the biological response of two its basic components: receptor-regulated pathways and chromatin remodeling. Upregulation the first group supposes to increase sensitivity of irradiated cells to chemokines and cytokines while downregulation of the second group would likely affect the DNA methylation pattern and stimulate the transcription.

OSD-370,Insulin resistance induced by physical inactivity is associated with multiple transcriptional changes in skeletal muscle in young men,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Physical inactivity is a risk factor for insulin resistance. We examined the effect of nine days of bed rest on basal and insulin stimulated expression of genes potentially involved in insulin action by applying hypothesis-generating microarray in parallel with candidate gene real-time PCR approaches in 20 healthy, young men. Furthermore, we investigated whether bed rest affected DNA methylation in the promoter region of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PPARGC1A) gene. Subjects were re-examined after four weeks of retraining. Findings: Bed rest induced insulin resistance and altered the expression of more than 4,500 genes. These changes were only partly normalized after four weeks of retraining. Pathway analyses revealed significant down-regulation of 34 pathways, predominantly those of genes associated with mitochondrial function including PPARGC1A. Despite induction of insulin resistance, bed rest resulted in a paradoxically increased response to acute insulin in the general expression of genes, particularly those involved in inflammation and endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) stress. Furthermore, bed rest changed gene expressions of several insulin resistance and diabetes candidate genes. We also observed a trend toward increased PPARGC1A DNA methylation after bed rest. Conclusions: Impaired expression of PPARGC1A and other genes involved in mitochondrial function as well as a paradoxically increased response to insulin of genes involved in inflammation and ER stress may contribute to the development of insulin resistance induced by bed rest. Lack of complete normalization of changes after four weeks of exercise retraining underscores the importance of maintaining a minimum of daily physical activity.","Bed Rest

We assessed whether this response is specific and prolonged and is linked to epigenetic mechanisms. We focused on the response of the hippocampus at early (2-weeks) and late (20-week) time points following whole body proton irradiation. We examined two forms of DNA methylation, cytosine methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC). Impairments in object recognition, spatial memory retention, and network stability following proton irradiation were observed at the two-week time point and correlated with altered gene expression and 5hmC profiles that mapped to specific gene ontology pathways. Significant overlap was observed between DNA methylation changes at the 2 and 20-week time points demonstrating specificity and retention of changes in response to radiation. Moreover, a novel class of DNA methylation change was observed following an environmental challenge (i.e. space irradiation), characterized by both increased and decreased 5hmC levels along the entire gene body. These changes were mapped to genes encoding neuronal functions including postsynaptic gene ontology categories.

OSD-396,Gene-metabolite networks associated with impediment of bone fracture repair in spaceflight,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Adverse effects of spaceflight on musculoskeletal health increase the risk of bone injury and impairment of fracture healing. Its yet elusive molecular comprehension warrants immediate attention, since space travel is becoming more frequent. Here we examined the effects of spaceflight on bone fracture healing using a 2‚ÄØmm femoral segmental bone defect (SBD) model. Forty, 9-week-old, male C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 4 groups: 1) Sham surgery on Ground (G-Sham); 2) Sham surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Sham); 3) SBD surgery on Ground (G-Surgery); and 4) SBD surgery housed in Spaceflight (FLT-Surgery). Surgery procedures occurred 4‚ÄØdays prior to launch; post-launch, the spaceflight mice were house in the rodent habitats on the International Space Station (ISS) for approximately 4‚ÄØweeks before euthanasia. Mice remaining on the Earth were subjected to identical housing and experimental conditions. The right femur from half of the spaceflight and ground groups was investigated by micro-computed tomography (¬µCT). In the remaining mice, the callus regions from surgery groups and corresponding femoral segments in sham mice were probed by global transcriptomic and metabolomic assays. ¬µCT confirmed escalated bone loss in FLT-Sham compared to G-Sham mice. Comparing to their respective on-ground counterparts, the morbidity gene-network signal was inhibited in sham spaceflight mice but activated in the spaceflight callus. ¬µCT analyses of spaceflight callus revealed increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity. Activated apoptotic signals in spaceflight callus were synchronized with inhibited cell migration signals that potentially hindered the wound site to recruit growth factors. A major pro-apoptotic and anti-migration gene network, namely the RANK-NFŒ∫B axis, emerged as the central node in spaceflight callus. Concluding, spaceflight suppressed a unique biomolecular mechanism in callus tissue to facilitate a failed regeneration, which merits a customized intervention strategy.","Spaceflight

OSD-401,Alternative splicing regulates the physiological adaptation of the mouse hind limb postural and phasic muscles to microgravity,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"We sought to comprehensively elucidate the transcriptomic underpinnings of microgravity-induced muscle phenotypes in mice by evaluating both differential gene expression (DGE) and changes in alternative splicing (AS) due to extended spaceflight. Total RNA was isolated from the gastrocnemius and quadriceps, postural and phasic muscles of the hind limb, respectively, of 32-week-old female BALB/c mice exposed to microgravity or ground control conditions for nine weeks. RNA sequencing revealed that DGE and AS varied across postural and phasic muscle types with preferential employment of DGE in the gastrocnemius and AS in the quadriceps. Gene ontology analysis indicated that DGE and AS regulate distinct molecular processes. Various non-differentially expressed transcripts encoding musculoskeletal proteins (Tnnt3, Tnnt1, Neb, Ryr1, and Ttn) and muscle-specific RNA binding splicing regulators (Mbnl1 and Rbfox1) were found to have significant changes in AS that altered critical functional domains of their protein products. In striking contrast, microgravity-induced differentially expressed genes were associated with translation/ribosomal function and lipid metabolism. Our work serves as the first comprehensive investigation of coordinate changes in DGE and AS in large limb muscles across spaceflight. We propose that substantial remodeling of pre-mRNA by AS is a major component of transcriptomic adaptation of skeletal muscle to microgravity. The alternatively spliced genes identified here could be targeted by small molecule splicing regulator therapies to address microgravity-induced changes in muscle during spaceflight.","Spaceflight

OSD-406,Transcriptomic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana lines WS and sku5 to the Blue Origin NS-12 and Virgin Galactic VP-03 suborbital flights,Arabidopsis thaliana,Parabolic Flight Study,"The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3Œ∫:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3Œ∫:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight. Multiple genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were flown on either the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo (VG VP-03; Col-0 and WS) or Blue Origin New Shepard (BO NS-12; WS and sku5) suborbital flight platforms. Plates containing the seedlings, 10 days and 11 days old in VG and BO, respectively, were wrapped in Duvetyn Black-Out cloth and mounted to the internal wall of the FLEX imaging system payload used in these flights.

OSD-410,Dataset for dose and time-dependent transcriptional response to ionizing radiation exposure.,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"One of the most likely risks astronauts on long duration space missions face is exposure to ionizing radiation associated with highly energetic and charged heavy (HZE) particles. Since access to medical expertise on such a mission is limited at best, early diagnosis and mitigation of such exposure is critical. In order to accurately determine the time since exposure and dosage of exposure, dose- and time-dependent biomarkers are needed. Therefore, we performed a dose- and time-course transcriptional analysis for radiation exposure at 0, 0.15, 0.30, and 1.5 Gy with corresponding time points at 1 hour (hr)post-exposure as well as 2 hr and 6 hr using Affymetrix Human PrimeArray chips. The analysis of our data suggests a set of sensitive genetic biomarkers specific to each radiation level as well as generic radiation response biomarkers. Upregulated biomarkers can then be used within lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems to detect exposure to ionizing radiation. Overall design: A total of 100 human samples representing radiation exposure at levels 0 Gy, 0.15 Gy, 0.30 Gy and 1.5 Gy at time points 1 hour (hr), 2 hr, and 6 hr post-exposure were constructed. Blood samples were extracted from ten human volunteers, and were irradiated. Leukocytes were extracted, and gene expression was measured. Samples for all ten volunteers were measured at 1 hr and 2 hr for all four dose levels, while samples from volunteers 1,2,3,4, and 7 were measured at 6 hr, resulting in 10 replicates at 1 hr and 2 hr for each dosage, and 5 replicates at 6 hr post-exposure. Thus, a total of 25 samples at each of the four radiation levels were sampled, yielding the total of 100 samples.","Time of Sample Collection after Treatment

OSD-415,Serum metabolomics associating with circulating microRNA profiles reveal the role of miR-383-5p in rat hippocampus under simulated microgravity,Rattus norvegicus,Ground Study,"Microgravity impacts various aspects of human health. Yet the mechanisms of spaceflight-induced health problems are not elucidated. Here we mapped the fusion systemic analysis of the serum metabolome and the circulating microRNAome in a hindlimb unloading rat model to simulate microgravity. The response of serum metabolites and microRNAs to simulated microgravity (SMG) was striking. Integrated pathway analysis of altered serum metabolites and target genes of the significantly altered circulating miRNAs with Integrated Molecular Pathway-Level Analysis (IMPaLA) software was mainly suggestive of modulation of neurofunctional signaling pathways. Particularly, we revealed significantly increased miR-383-5p and decreased aquaporin 4 (AQP4) - in the hippocampus. Utilizing Rabies Virus Glycoprotein (RVG)-modified exosomes, delivery of miR-383-5p inhibited the expression of AQP4 not only in rat C6 glioma cells in vitro but also in the hippocampus in vivo. Using bioinformatics to map the crosstalk between the circulating metabolome and miRNAome could offer opportunities to understand complex biological systems under microgravity. Our present results suggested that the change of miR-383-5p level and its regulation of target gene AQP4 was one of the potential molecular mechanisms of microgravity induced cognitive impairment in the hippocampus. MiRNA plays an important role during the adaptation to microgavity. In this study, effects of simulated microgravity on circulating microRNA profiles were performed to screen different expression miRNA and gravity-sensitive miRNAs. To investigate the influence of simulated microgravity on the circulating miRNAome, the male SD rats were randomly assigned to the control group or the hindlimb unloading group to simulated microgravity for 28 days under 12hr light/12hr dark schedule. Total miRNA was extracted form Serum and used for miRNA microarray analysis with 3 pooled control samples and 4 pooled Hindlimb suspension simulated microgravity samples (each pool was composed of 4 individual serum samples with the same volume).",Hindlimb Unloading,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/jj6a-7v64

Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants, methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5), that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls.

Specific functionally assigned gene clusters of Lactobacillus murinus and Dorea sp. capable of producing metabolites, lactic acid, leucine/isoleucine, and glutathione are enriched. These metabolites are elevated in the microgravity-exposed host serum through LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis.

OSD-426,Cerium oxide nanoparticle administration to skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation conditions,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"For their remarkable biomimetic properties implying strong modulation of the intracellular and extracellular redox state, cerium oxide nanoparticles (also termed 'nanoceria') were hypothesized to exert a protective role against oxidative stress associated to the harsh environmental conditions of spaceflight, characterized by microgravity and highly energetic radiations. Nanoparticles were supplied to proliferating C2C12 mouse skeletal muscle cells under different gravity and radiation levels (microgravity+cosmic radiations or Earth gravity+cosmic radiations on board the International Space Station; Earth gravity on ground). Biological responses were thus investigated at a transcriptional level by RNA next-generation sequencing. Lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were generated and intersected by taking into consideration relevant comparisons, which led to the observation of prevailing effects of the space environment over those induced by nanoceria, possibly due to its administration during spaceflight. In space, up-regulation of transcription was slightly preponderant over down-regulation, and it implied involvement of intracellular compartments, with the majority of DEGs being consistently over- or under-expressed whenever present. Cosmic radiations regulated a higher number of DEGs than microgravity and seemed to promote increased cellular catabolism. By taking into consideration space physical stressors alone, microgravity and cosmic radiations appeared to have opposite effects at transcriptional level despite partial sharing of molecular pathways. Interestingly, gene ontology denoted some enrichment in terms related to vision, when only effects of radiation were assessed. The regulation of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 in space-relevant samples suggests perturbation of the intracellular redox homeostasis, and leaves open opportunities to antioxidant treatment for oxidative stress reduction in harsh environments. RNA-seq/miRNA-seq of C2C12 proliferating mouse myoblasts, cultured in the following conditions (n of 3): A (without nanoceria, in space without gravity), B (with nanoceria, in space without gravity), C (without nanoceria, in space with gravity), D (with nanoceria, in space with gravity), E (without nanoceria, on land), and F (with nanoceria, on land).","Spaceflight

[RNA-Seq],Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"Epigenetic changes in the DNA methylome are increasingly shown to play an integral role in regulating gene expression necessary for plants adaption to environmental stressors. Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants (methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5) that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls.

This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3Œ∫:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3Œ∫:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses.

OSD-431,Microgravity and space radiation exert either opposite or synergic effects on single molecular pathways,Homo sapiens,Spaceflight Study,"Microgravity and space radiation (SR) are two highly influential factors affecting humans in space flight. Many health problems reported by astronauts derive from endothelial dysfunction and impaired homeostasis. Here we describe the adaptive response of human, capillary endothelial cells to space. Reference samples on ground and at 1g onboard allowed discrimination between the contribution of microgravity and SR within the combined response to space. Cell softening and reduced motility occurred in space, with loss of actin stress fibers and a greater distribution of microtubules and intermediate filaments in compensation. The frequency of primary cilia also increased. DNA repair mechanisms were indeed activated. Transcriptomics highlighted the opposing effect of microgravity from SR on specific molecular pathways: radiation, unlike microgravity, stimulated pathways for endothelial activation (hypoxia, inflammation), DNA repair and apoptosis, promoting an ageing-like phenotype; microgravity, unlike SR, activated pathways for metabolism and pro-proliferation phenotype. Thus, microgravity and SR should be considered separately to tailor effective countermeasures to protect astronauts‚Äô health. To identify transcriptional changes induced by microgravity, space radiation, and their combination together with other stimuli in space flight, we used a model of human endothelial cells of microvascular origin (HMEC-1). Space samples were exposed to environmental microgravity (g) or set inside the centrifuge reproducing 1g; on ground samples were used as ground control.","Spaceflight

In comparison to tumors from p53 single heterozygous (p53+/-) mice, we find that tumors from Fbxw7/p53 double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/-p53+/-) mice show significant deregulation of cholesterol metabolic processes independent of rapamycin treatment, while cell cycle related genes were upregulated in tumors from placebo treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice, but not in tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice. On the other hand, tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/-p53+/- mice were enriched for genes involved in the integrated stress response, an adaptive mechanism to survive in stressful environments. p53+/‚àí and p53+/‚àíFbxw7+/‚àí mice were generated by crossing p53-/- mice with Fbxw7+/- mice.

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6‚ÄØJ mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26‚ÄØGy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1‚ÄØGy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55‚ÄØGy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1‚ÄØGy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5‚ÄØGy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1‚ÄØGy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs Œ≥ rays (1‚ÄØGy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3‚ÄØGy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to Œ≥ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of Œ± smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than Œ≥ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the cardiac ultrasound and abdominal aorta doppler (echocardiography) assays.","Ionizing Radiation

Selecting experiments favoring broader exploration followed by fine-tuning emerged as the optimal strategy.

We then profiled global gene expression in blood from individual mice using Agilent microarrays. In general, we found increasing numbers of genes differentially expressed with increasing dose, with more prolonged responses after the higher doses. Gene ontology analysis showed a similar pattern, with more biological processes enriched among the genes responding to higher doses, and at later times after exposure. Clustering the timecourse expression data using maSigPro identified four broad patterns of response, representing different gene ontology functions. The largest of these clusters included genes with initially decreased expression followed by increased expression at later times, a pattern of expression previously reported for several genes following neutron exposure. Another gene cluster showing consistent down regulation suggests genes useful for biodosimetry throughout the first week after exposure can be identified.","Time of Sample Collection after Treatment

OSD-469,Transcriptomic analysis of the interaction between FLOWERING LOCUS T induction and photoperiodic signaling in response to spaceflight,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"Spaceflight has an impact on growth and development of higher plants at both vegetative stage and reproductive stage. A great deal of information has been available on the vegetative stage in space, but relatively little is known about the influence of spaceflight on plants at the reproductive stage. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing flowering control gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), together with green fluorescent protein gene(GFP) under control of a heat shock-inducible promoter (HSP17.4), by which we induced FT expression inflight through remote controlling heating shock (HS) treatment. Inflight photography data showed that induction of FT expression in plants in space under short-day condition could eliminated the difference of stem length between spaceflight and ground control . Whole-genome microarray analysis of gene expression changes in leaves of wild-type and these transgenic plants grown under the long-day and short-day photoperiod conditions in space indicated that the function of the photoperiod-related spaceflight responsive genes are mainly involved in protein synthesis and post-translation protein modulation, notably protein phosphorylation. In addition, changes of circadian component gene expression in response to spaceflight under different photoperiod indicated that roles of circadian oscillator could act as integrators of spaceflight response and photoperiodic signals in Arabidopsis plants grown in space.","Spaceflight

OSD-471,Spaceflight-Induced Bone Loss Alters Failure Mode and Reduces Bending Strength in Murine Spinal Segments from Bion-M1,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Intervertebral disc herniation rates are quadrupled in astronauts following spaceflight. While bending motions are main contributors to herniation, the effects of microgravity on the bending properties of spinal discs are unknown. Consequently, the goal of this study was to quantify the bending properties of tail discs from mice with or without microgravity exposure. Caudal motion segments from six mice returned from a 30-day Bion M1 mission and eight vivarium controls were loaded to failure in four-point bending. After testing, specimens were processed using histology to determine the location of failure, and adjacent motion segments were scanned with micro-computed tomography (mCT) to quantify bone properties. We observed that spaceflight significantly shortened the nonlinear toe region of the force-displacement curve by 32% and reduced the bending strength by 17%. Flight mouse spinal segments tended to fail within the growth plate and epiphyseal bone, while controls tended to fail at the disc-vertebra junction. Spaceflight significantly reduced vertebral bone volume fraction, bone mineral density, and trabecular thickness, which may explain the tendency of flight specimens to fail within the epiphyseal bone. Together, these results indicate that vertebral bone loss during spaceflight may degrade spine bending properties and contribute to increased disc herniation risk in astronauts.

Using samples from Apollo 11, 12 and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop, expressed genes indicative of ionic stresses, and many showed severe stress morphologies. Therefore, although in situ lunar regolith can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates.

Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n‚Äâ equals 11‚Äì12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the Mechanical Testing, Bone Microstructure (microCT), and bone histomorphometry assays using femur tissue.","Partial Weight Bearing

OSD-478,Altered rodent gait characteristics after ~35 days in orbit aboard the International Space Station,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"The long-term adaptations to microgravity and other spaceflight challenges within the confines of a spacecraft, and readaptations to weight-bearing upon reaching a destination, are unclear. While post-flight gait change in astronauts have been well documented and reflect multi-system deficits, no data from rodents have been collected. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate gait changes in response to spaceflight. A prospective collection of gait data was collected on 3 groups of mice: those who spent~35 days in orbit (FLIGHT) aboard the International Space Station (ISS); a ground-based control with the same habitat conditions as ISS (Ground Control; GC); and a vivarium control with typical rodent housing conditions (VIV). Pre-flight and post-flight gait measurements were conducted utilizing an optimized and portable gait analysis system (DigiGait, Mouse Specifics, Inc). The total data acquisition time for gait patterns of FLIGHT and control mice was 1.5‚Äì5 min/mouse, allowing all 20 mice per group to be assessed in less than an hour. Patterns of longitudinal gait changes were observed in the hind limbs and the forelimbs of the FLIGHT mice after ~35 days in orbit; few differences were observed in gait characteristics within the GC and VIV controls from the initial to the final gait assessment, and between groups. For FLIGHT mice, 12 out of 18 of the evaluated gait characteristics in the hind limbs were significantly changed, including: stride width variability; stride length and variance; stride, swing, and stance duration; paw angle and area at peak stance; and step angle, among others. Gait characteristics that decreased included stride frequency, and others. Moreover, numerous forelimb gait characteristics in the FLIGHT mice were changed at post-flight measures relative to pre-flight. This rapid DigiGait gait measurement tool and customized spaceflight protocol is useful for providing preliminary insight into how spaceflight could affect multiple systems in rodents in which deficits are reflected by altered gait characteristics.

Exposure to such stressors is associated with adverse effects on astronauts' health, including increased cancer and cardiovascular disease risks. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs, i.e., exosomes) play a vital role in intercellular communication and regulate various biological processes contributing to their role in disease pathogenesis. To assess whether spaceflight alters sEVs transcriptome profile, sEVs were isolated from the blood plasma of 3 astronauts at two different time points: 10 days before launch (L-10) and 3 days after return (R+3) from the Shuttle mission. Human adult ventricular cardiomyocyte cells (AC16) were treated with L-10 and R+3 astronauts-derived exosomes for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated and analyzed for gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarrays. Enrichment analysis was performed using Enrichr. Transcription factor enrichment analysis using the ENCODE/ChEA Consensus TF database identified gene sets related to the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and Vitamin D receptor (VDR) in AC16 cells treated with R+3 compared to cells treated with L-10 astronauts-derived exosomes. Further analysis of the histone modifications using datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics Project confirmed enrichment in gene sets related to the H3K27me3 repressive mark. Interestingly, analysis of previously published H3K27me3‚Äìchromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) ENCODE datasets showed enrichment of H3K27me3 in the VDR promoter. Collectively, our results suggest that astronaut-derived sEVs may epigenetically repress the expression of the VDR in human adult cardiomyocytes c by promoting the activation of the PRC2 complex and H3K27me3 levels. Gene expression was measured in untreated (n equals 3) and exosome-treated (n equals 6) AC16 human cardiomyocyte cell line.

The 29th DLR parabolic flight campaign consisted of four consecutive flight days with thirty-one parabolas each day. Euglena gracilis cells were fixed with TRIzol during different acceleration conditions at the first and the last parabola of each flight. Samples were collected and analyzed with microarrays for one-color gene expression analysis. The data indicate significant changes in gene expression in E. gracilis within short time. Hierarchical clustering shows that changes induced by the different accelerations yield reproducible effects at independent flight days. Transcription differed between the first and last parabolas indicating adaptation effects in the course of the flight. Different gene groups were found to be affected in different phases of the parabolic flight, among others, genes involved in signal transduction, calcium signaling, transport mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and stress-response as well as membrane and cytoskeletal proteins. In addition, transcripts of other areas, e.g., DNA and protein modification, were altered.

OSD-486,Fifteen days of microgravity causes growth in calvaria of mice (STS-131),Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Bone growth may occur in spaceflight as a response to skeletal unloading and head-ward fluid shifts. While unloading causes significant loss of bone mass and density in legs of animals exposed to microgravity, increased blood and interstitial fluid flows accompanying microgravity-induced fluid redistribution may elicit an opposite effect in the head. Seven 23-week-old, adult female wild-type C57BL/6 mice were randomly chosen for exposure to 15 days of microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight female littermates served as ground controls. Upon mission completion, all 15 murine calvariae were imaged on a micro-computed tomography scanner. A standardized rectangular volume was placed on the parietal bones of each calvaria for analyses, and three parameters were determined to measure increased parietal bone volume: bone volume (BV), average cortical thickness (Ct.Th), and tissue mineral density (TMD). Microgravity exposure caused a statistically significant increase in BV of the spaceflight (SF) group compared to that of the ground control (GC) group, the mean BV ¬± SD for the SF group was 1.904 ¬± 0.842 mm3, compared to 1.758 ¬± 0.122 mm3 for the GC group (p less than 0.05). Ct.Th demonstrated a trend of increase from 0.099 ¬± 0.006 mm in the GC group to 0.104 ¬± 0.005 mm in the SF group (p equals 0.12). TMD was similar between the two groups with 0.878 ¬± 0.029 g/cm3 for the GC group and 0.893 ¬± 0.028 g/cm3 for the SF group (p equals 0.31). Our results indicate that microgravity causes responsive changes in calvarial bones that do not normally bear weight.

OSD-488,Characterizing SERCA Function in Murine Skeletal Muscles after 35-37 Days of Spaceflight from RR-1 and RR-9 (calcium uptake and Western blot in soleus and tibialis anterior),Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"It is well established that microgravity exposure causes significant muscle weakness and atrophy via muscle unloading. On Earth, muscle unloading leads to a disproportionate loss in muscle force and size with the loss in muscle force occurring at a faster rate. Although the exact mechanisms are unknown, a role for Ca2+ dysregulation has been suggested. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump actively brings cytosolic Ca2+ into the SR, eliciting muscle relaxation and maintaining low intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i). SERCA dysfunction contributes to elevations in [Ca2+]i, leading to cellular damage, and may contribute to the muscle weakness and atrophy observed with spaceflight. Here, we investigated SERCA function, SERCA regulatory protein content, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) protein adduction in murine skeletal muscle after 35-37 days of spaceflight. In male and female soleus muscles, spaceflight led to drastic impairments in Ca2+ uptake despite significant increases in SERCA1a protein content. We attribute this impairment to an increase in RONS production and elevated total protein tyrosine (T) nitration and cysteine (S) nitrosylation. Contrarily, in the tibialis anterior (TA), we observed an enhancement in Ca2+ uptake, which we attribute to a shift towards a faster muscle fiber type (i.e., increased myosin heavy chain IIb and SERCA1a) without elevated total protein T-nitration and S-nitrosylation. Thus, spaceflight affects SERCA function differently between the soleus and TA. This dataset derives results from the calcium uptake (spectrofluorometry) and Western blot assays.","Spaceflight

In addition to changes in cognitive/behavioral performance, aged rats also show an increase in baseline anxiety measured using the elevated plus maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles, a component of cosmic rays, produces neurochemical and behavioral changes in young animals which are characteristic of aged organisms. The present study was designed to determine the relationships between aging and exposure to 56Fe particles on anxiety. Fischer 344 (F344) rats, which were 2, 7, 12, and 16 months of age at the time of irradiation, were exposed to 56Fe particles (50 to 200 cGy). Concordant with previous results, the oldest rats spent less time exploring the open arms of the maze. Exposure to 56Fe particles also produced decreased exploration of the open arms of the plus maze. The dose needed to produce increased levels of anxiety was a function of age at the time of irradiation. The dose of 56Fe particles needed to produce a decrease in open arm exploration was significantly lower in the rats that were irradiated at 7 and 12 months of age than in the rats irradiated at 2 months of age. These results suggest the possibility that exposing middle aged astronauts to cosmic rays during exploratory class missions outside the magnetosphere, and the resultant effects on exploration induced anxiety, may affect their ability to successfully complete mission requirements.

Within these networks, additional chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic experiments revealed that SOG1 is the major activator, directly targeting the most strongly up-regulated genes, including TFs, repair factors, and early cell cycle regulators, while three MYB3R TFs are the major repressors, specifically targeting the most strongly down-regulated genes, which mainly correspond to G2/M cell cycle-regulated genes. Together these models reveal the temporal dynamics of the transcriptional events triggered by Œ≥-irradiation and connects these events to TFs and biological processes over a time scale commensurate with key processes coordinated in response to DNA damage, greatly expanding our understanding of the DDR.","Genotype

Because of the potential threat of S. aureus to astronaut health, the effect of spaceflight conditions on this pathogen is of great interest. To gain insight into the virulence potential of S. aureus in the spaceflight environment, we performed differential expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq and cellular proteomics data from the ‚ÄúBiological Research in Canisters-23‚Äù (BRIC-23) GeneLab spaceflight experiment, a mission designed to measure the response of S. aureus to growth in low earth orbit (LEO) on the international space station (ISS). This experiment used Biological Research in Canisters-Petri Dish Fixation Units (BRIC-PDFUs) to grow asynchronous ground controls (GCs) and spaceflight cultures of S. aureus for 48 hours. Analysis of the RNA-Seq data revealed that RNAIII, the effector of the Accessory Gene Regulator (Agr) quorum sensing system, was the most highly upregulated gene in spaceflight cultures (~88-fold) relative to GCs. Genes of the agr operon (~14 fold) were also highly upregulated during spaceflight, followed by genes encoding secreted phenol-soluble modulins (PSMs) and secreted proteases, all of which are positively regulated by Agr. Upregulated spaceflight genes/proteins also had functions related to urease activity, Ess secretion, and copper transport. We also performed a secretome analysis of culture supernatant samples from BRIC-23. In line with the other BRIC-23 omics data, spaceflight supernatants displayed significantly increased abundance of several known secreted virulence factors, including Agr-regulated proteases (SspA, SspB), staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc), and EsxA, a small protein secreted by the type VII-like Ess secretion system. These data also suggested that S. aureus metabolism is altered in space flight conditions relative to the ground controls (increased amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle and PTS systems, and decreased glycolysis/fermentation and translation machinery).

Translating the results from ground-based rodent studies into tangible risk estimates for astronauts is an enormous challenge, but it would be germane for NASA to use the vast body of data from the rodent studies to start developing appropriate countermeasures, in the expectation that some level of space radiation (SR) -induced cognitive impairment could occur in astronauts. While some targeted studies have reported radiation-induced changes in the neurotransmission properties and/or increased neuroinflammation within space radiation exposed brains, there remains little information that can be used to start the development of a mechanism-based countermeasure strategy. In this study, we have employed a robust label-free mass spectrometry (MS) -based untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling approach to characterize the composition of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) proteome in rats that have been exposed to 15 cGy of 600 MeV/n 28Si ions. A variety of analytical techniques were used to mine the generated expression data, which in such studies is typically hampered by low and variable sample size. We have identified several proteins whose expression alters as a result of space radiation exposure, and a further subset of proteins differs in rats that have a high level of cognitive performance after SR exposure in comparison with those that have low performance levels. While this study has provided further insight into how SR impacts upon neurophysiology, and what adaptive responses can be invoked to prevent the emergence of SR-induced cognitive impairment, the main objective of this paper is to outline strategies that can be used by others to analyze sub-optimal data sets and to identify new information.",Ionizing Radiation,protein expression profiling,,,10.26030/9fzm-jc44

OSD-508,The SOG1 transcriptional activator and the MYB3R family of repressors control a complex gene network in response to DNA damage in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq t vs t0],Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"To combat DNA damage, organisms mount a DNA damage response (DDR) that results in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and, in severe cases, cell death. Underscoring the importance of gene regulation in this response, studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated that all of the aforementioned processes rely on SUPPRESSOR OF GAMMA RESPONSE 1 (SOG1), a NAC family transcription factor (TF) that has been functionally equated to the mammalian tumor suppressor, p53. However, the expression networks connecting SOG1 to these processes remain largely unknown and, although the DDR spans from minutes to hours, most transcriptomic data correspond to single time-point snapshots. Here, we generated transcriptional models of the DDR from GAMMA (Œ≥)-irradiated wild-type and sog1 seedlings during a 24-hour time course using DREM, the Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner, revealing 11 coexpressed gene groups with distinct biological functions and cis-regulatory features. Within these networks, additional chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic experiments revealed that SOG1 is the major activator, directly targeting the most strongly up-regulated genes, including TFs, repair factors, and early cell cycle regulators, while three MYB3R TFs are the major repressors, specifically targeting the most strongly down-regulated genes, which mainly correspond to G2/M cell cycle-regulated genes. Together these models reveal the temporal dynamics of the transcriptional events triggered by Œ≥-irradiation and connects these events to TFs and biological processes over a time scale commensurate with key processes coordinated in response to DNA damage, greatly expanding our understanding of the DDR.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-509,A CRISPR-based assay for the study of eukaryotic DNA repair onboard the International Space Station.,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Spaceflight Study,"As we explore beyond Earth, astronauts may be at risk for harmful DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. Double-strand breaks are a type of DNA damage that can be repaired by two major cellular pathways: non-homologous end joining, during which insertions or deletions may be added at the break site, and homologous recombination, in which the DNA sequence often remains unchanged. Previous work suggests that space conditions may impact the choice of DNA repair pathway, potentially compounding the risks of increased radiation exposure during space travel. However, our understanding of this problem has been limited by technical and safety concerns, which have prevented integral study of the DNA repair process in space. The CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system offers a model for the safe and targeted generation of double-strand breaks in eukaryotes. Here we describe a CRISPR-based assay for DNA break induction and assessment of double-strand break repair pathway choice entirely in space. As necessary steps in this process, we describe the first successful genetic transformation and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in space. These milestones represent a significant expansion of the molecular biology toolkit onboard the International Space Station.","Spaceflight

We report CNS changes in Drosophila aboard the International Space Station in response to microgravity (SFŒºg) and artificially simulated Earth-gravity (SF1g) via inflight centrifugation as a countermeasure. While inflight behavioral analyses of SFŒºg exhibit increased activity, postflight analysis displays significant climbing defects, highlighting the sensitivity of behavior to altered gravity. Multi-omics analysis shows alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFŒºg and SF1g; however, neurological changes immediately postflight, including neuronal loss, glial cell count alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, are seen only in SFŒºg. Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFŒºg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFŒºg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions. Overall, our results indicate that artificial gravity partially protects the CNS from the adverse effects of spaceflight.","Sex

OSD-518,Opposing influences of TAC1 and LAZY1 on Lateral Shoot Orientation in Arabidopsis.,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"TAC1 and LAZY1 are members of a gene family that regulates lateral shoot orientation in plants. TAC1 promotes outward orientations in response to light, while LAZY1 promotes upward shoot orientations in response to gravity via altered auxin transport. We performed genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays to investigate possible interactions between these genes. In Arabidopsis they were expressed in similar tissues and double mutants revealed the wide-angled lazy1 branch phenotype, indicating it is epistatic to the tac1 shoot phenotype. Surprisingly, the lack of TAC1 did not influence gravitropic shoot curvature responses. Combined, these results suggest TAC1 might negatively regulate LAZY1 to promote outward shoot orientations. However, additional results revealed that TAC1- and LAZY1 influence on shoot orientation is more complex than a simple direct negative regulatory pathway. Transcriptomes of Arabidopsis tac1 and lazy1 mutants compared to wild type under normal and gravistimulated conditions revealed few overlapping differentially expressed genes. Overexpression of each gene did not result in major branch angle differences. Shoot tip hormone levels were similar between tac1, lazy1, and Col, apart from exceptionally elevated levels of salicylic acid in lazy1. The data presented here provide a foundation for future study of TAC1 and LAZY1 regulation of shoot architecture.","Genotype

OSD-519,PUCHI represses early meristem formation in developing lateral roots of Arabidopsis thaliana,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Time-series RNAseq analysis following lateral root induction by gravistimulation. Lateral root organogenesis is a key process in the development of a plant‚Äôs root system and its adaptation to the environment. During lateral root formation, an early phase of cell proliferation first produces a four-cell-layered primordium, and only from this stage onwards is a root meristem-like structure, expressing root stem cell niche marker genes, being established in the developing organ. Previous studies reported that the gene regulatory network controlling lateral root formation is organized into two subnetworks whose mutual inhibition may contribute to organ patterning. PUCHI encodes an AP2/ERF transcription factor expressed early during lateral root primordium development and required for correct lateral root formation. To dissect the molecular events occurring during this early phase, we generated time-series transcriptomic datasets profiling lateral root development in puchi-1 mutants and wild types. Transcriptomic and reporter analyses revealed that meristem-related genes were expressed ectopically at early stages of lateral root formation in puchi-1 mutants. We conclude that, consistent with the inhibition of genetic modules contributing to lateral root development, PUCHI represses ectopic establishment of meristematic cell identities at early stages of organ development. These findings shed light on gene network properties that orchestrate correct timing and patterning during lateral root formation.","Genotype

OSD-520,Changes in DNA Methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana Plants Exposed Over Multiple Generations to Gamma Radiation,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Previous studies have found indications that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) results in DNA methylation changes in plants. However, this phenomenon is yet to be studied across multiple generations. Furthermore, the exact role of these changes in the IR-induced plant response is still far from understood. Here, we study the effect of gamma radiation on DNA methylation and its effect across generations in young Arabidopsis plants. A multigenerational set-up was used in which three generations (Parent, generation 1, and generation 2) of 7-day old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were exposed to either of the different radiation treatments (30, 60, 110, or 430 mGy/h) or to natural background radiation (control condition) for 14 days. The parental generation consisted of previously non-exposed plants, whereas generation 1 and generation 2 plants had already received a similar irradiation in the previous one or two generations, respectively. Directly after exposure the entire methylomes were analysed with UPLC-MS/MS to measure whole genome methylation levels. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), including their methylation context in the three generations and this for three different radiation conditions (control, 30 mGy/h, and 110 mGy/h). Both intra- and intergenerational comparisons of the genes and transposable elements associated with the DMRs were made. Taking the methylation context into account, the highest number of changes were found for cytosines followed directly by guanine (CG methylation), whereas only limited changes in CHG methylation occurred and no changes in CHH methylation were observed. A clear increase in IR-induced DMRs was seen over the three generations that were exposed to the lowest dose rate, where generation 2 had a markedly higher number of DMRs than the previous two generations (Parent and generation 1). Counterintuitively, we did not see significant differences in the plants exposed to the highest dose rate. A large number of DMRs associated with transposable elements were found, the majority of them being hypermethylated, likely leading to more genetic stability. Next to that, a significant number of DMRs were associated with genes (either in their promoter-associated region or gene body). A functional analysis of these genes showed an enrichment for genes related to development as well as various stress responses, including DNA repair, RNA splicing, and (a)biotic stress responses. These observations indicate a role of DNA methylation in the regulation of these genes in response to IR exposure and shows a possible role for epigenetics in plant adaptation to IR over multiple generations.","Generation

OSD-522,Integrative Transcriptomics and Proteomics Profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana Elucidates Novel Mechanisms Underlying Spaceflight Adaptation,Arabidopsis thaliana,Spaceflight Study,"Spaceflight presents a unique environment with complex stressors, including microgravity and radiation, that can influence plant physiology at molecular levels. Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis‚Äô molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (¬µg) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters -Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.","Organism Part

OSD-524,Ionizing radiation induces transgenerational effects of DNA methylation in zebrafish,Danio rerio,Ground Study,"Ionizing radiation is known to cause DNA damage, yet the mechanisms underlying potential transgenerational effects of exposure have been scarcely studied. Previously, we observed effects in offspring of zebrafish exposed to gamma radiation during gametogenesis. Here, we hypothesize that these effects are accompanied by changes of DNA methylation possibly inherited by subsequent generations. We assessed DNA methylation in F1 embryos (5.5 hours post fertilization) with whole genome bisulfite sequencing following parental exposure to 8.7 mGy/h for 27 days and found 5658 differentially methylated regions (DMRs). DMRs were predominantly located at known regulatory regions, such as gene promoters and enhancers. Pathway analysis indicated the involvement of DMRs related to similar pathways found with gene expression analysis, such as development, apoptosis and cancers, which could be linked to previous observed developmental defects and genomic instability in the offspring. Follow up of 19 F1 DMRs in F2 and F3 embryos revealed persistent effects up to the F3 generation at 5 regions. These results indicate that ionizing radiation related effects in offspring can be linked to DNA methylation changes that partly can persist over generations. Monitoring DNA methylation could serve as a biomarker to provide an indication of ancestral exposures to ionizing radiation.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-530,Cell-free RNA analysis of plasma samples collected from six astronauts in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study,Homo sapiens,Spaceflight Study,"A detailed understanding of how the human body responds to spaceflight will be important to develop countermeasures for long-term space exploration. Liquid biopsies offer minimally invasive alternatives to traditional tissue biopsies, while also permitting the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids, which may resolve molecular heterogeneity and extend the multi-omics scope better than standard methods. Full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. Here, we perform a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days, and show that plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) can capture longitudinal gene expression responses of internal tissues to the spaceflight environment. Analysis of cfRNA collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirmed previously reported mitochondria dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identified an extracellular mitochondria (exMT)-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing analysis of the CD36 fraction revealed various tissue origins, some of which have not been well characterized due to their conventional inaccessibility. We compared our data to plasma cfRNA mouse data from a JAXA mission, in which on-board artificial gravity had been used, and discovered that microgravity induced the observed systemic responses. Our study used minimally invasive approaches to demonstrate exMT release as a conserved process in space and establishes the impact of gravity on Earth as an essential signal for normal homeostasis.","Spaceflight

OSD-531,Identification of gravitropic response indicator genes in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems,Arabidopsis thaliana,Ground Study,"Differential organ growth during gravitropic response is caused by differential accumulation of auxin, that is, relative higher auxin concentration in lower flanks than in upper flanks of responding organs. Auxin responsive reporter systems such as DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP have usually been used as indicators of gravitropic response in roots and hypocotyls of Arabidopsis. However, in the inflorescence stems, the reporter systems don't work well to monitor gravitropic response. Here, we aim to certify appropriate gravitropic response indicators (GRIs) in inflorescence stems. We performed microarray analysis comparing gene expression profiles between upper and lower flanks of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems after gravistimulation. Thirty genes showed greater than 2-fold differentially increased expression in lower flanks at 30 min, of which 19 were auxin response genes. We focused on IAA5 and IAA2 and verified whether they are appropriate GRIs by real-time qRT-PCR analyses. Transcript levels of IAA5 and IAA2 were remarkably higher in lower flanks than in upper flanks after gravistimulation. The biased IAA5 or IAA2 expression is disappeared in sgr2-1 mutant which is defective in gravity perception, indicating that gravity perception process is essential for formation of the biased gene expression during gravitropism. IAA5 expression was remarkably increased in lower flanks at 30 min after gravistimulation, whereas IAA2 expression was gradually decreased in upper flanks in a time-dependent manner. Therefore, we conclude that IAA5 is a sensitive GRI to monitor asymmetric auxin signaling caused by gravistimulation in Arabidopsis inflorescence stems.","Treatment

Brain tissues were collected for analysis. Habitat ground control (GC) mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware cages. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoStringTM) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. The Neuroinflammation panel includes 757 genes covering the core pathways and processes that define neuroimmune interactions. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p less than 0.05) significantly segregates the GC group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated in FLT compared to the GC mice. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. These data indicate that neuroinflammation and altered immune reactions may be closely associate with spaceflight-induced stress response and have an impact on the neuronal function that may result in chronic neuroinflammation and late neurodegeneration. A total of 12 frozen right caudal half hemispheres containing mid- and hindbrain from GC and FLT mice (n equals 6 per group), were used for analysis",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,SpaceX-12,Rodent Habitat,10.26030/bg5q-t229

But little is known about the effect of spaceflight or simulated spaceflight microgravity on the transcriptome of tissue-engineered cartilage developed from human cells. In this study, we investigate the effect of simulated spaceflight microgravity facilitated by parabolic flights on tissue-engineered cartilage developed from chondrogenically differentiated human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells obtained from age-matched female and male donors. Our bulk transcriptome data via RNA sequencing demonstrated that the engineered tissues responded to parabolic microgravity in a sex-dependent manner.","Sex

OSD-540,Ten-day human unilateral lower limb suspension and active recovery in young healthy men,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"Electrophysiological alterations of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) with unloading are poorly studied. We aimed to investigate these aspects and the underlying molecular mechanisms with short-term unloading and active recovery (AR). Eleven healthy males underwent a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) period, followed by 21-day AR based on resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris (QF) cross-sectional area (CSA) and isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were evaluated. Intramuscular electromyographic recordings were obtained during 10% and 25% MVC isometric contractions from the vastus lateralis (VL). Biomarkers of NMJ molecular instability (serum c-terminal agrin fragment, CAF), axonal damage (neurofilament light chain) and denervation status were assessed from blood samples and VL biopsies. NMJ and ion channel transcriptomic profiles were investigated by RNA-sequencing. QF CSA and MVC decreased with ULLS. Increased CAF and altered NMJ transcriptome with unloading suggested the emergence of NMJ molecular instability, which was not associated with impaired NMJ transmission stability. Instead, increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates were found after ULLS. Downregulation of ion channel gene expression was found together with increased neurofilament light chain concentration and partial denervation. The AR period restored most of these neuromuscular alterations. In conclusion, the human NMJ is destabilized at the molecular level but shows functional resilience to a 10-day unloading period at least at relatively low contraction intensities. However, MUP properties are altered by ULLS, possibly due to alterations in ion channel dynamics and initial axonal damage and denervation. These changes are fully reversed by 21 days of AR. KEY POINTS: We used integrative electrophysiological and molecular approaches to comprehensively investigate changes in neuromuscular integrity and function after a 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS), followed by 21 days of active recovery in young healthy men, with a particular focus on neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and motor unit potential (MUP) properties alterations. After 10-day ULLS, we found significant NMJ molecular alterations in the absence of NMJ transmission stability impairment. These findings suggest that the human NMJ is functionally resilient against insults and stresses induced by short-term disuse at least at relatively low contraction intensities, at which low-threshold, slow-type motor units are recruited. Intramuscular electromyography analysis revealed that unloading caused increased MUP complexity and decreased motor unit firing rates, and these alterations could be related to the observed changes in skeletal muscle ion channel pool and initial and partial signs of fibre denervation and axonal damage. The active recovery period restored these neuromuscular changes.",Hindlimb Unloading,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/aqem-m481
OSD-542,Effects of 14 days of confinement on blood gene expression profiles in men,Homo sapiens,Ground Study,"The effects of short-term confinement on gene expression profiles in blood were evaluated. Fourteen days confinement study was conducted 2 times. In each experiment, 8 male subjects were stayed in an isolation and confinement facility at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. DNA microarray of extracted RNA from whole blood samples revealed that the expression levels of 3,659 genes were significantly altered by the 14-day confinement. The changes in gene expression profiles were not exactly the same as those in response to the other stress conditions, such as chronic psychological stress and spaceflight. In particular, 7 genes, LIN9, AK125040.1, MGC45922, C9orf173-AS1, OR1P1P, KRTAP10-12, and ARFRP1, responded to the confinement prominently. Therefore, the analysis of expression levels of these genes might be useful to assess the stress responses of human body to the confinement. In addition, biological interpretation of the alteration of gene expression profiles with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis indicated that 14-day confinement stimulated various signaling related to pro inflammation and leukocyte extravasation but suppressed apoptosis signaling. In agreement with the interpretation, the decrease of white blood cells in blood was confirmed during the confinement. On the other hand, red blood cells and platelets did not decrease. These results suggest that 14-day confinement is likely to induce shift of white blood cells from ‚Äúthe circulating pool‚Äù to ‚Äúthe marginated pool‚Äù.",Time,transcription profiling,,,10.26030/1b25-m388

To gain insight into the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in response to radiation and microgravity, we analyzed RNA expression profiles in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells incubated for 24 h in static condition or in rotating condition to stimulate microgravity in space after 2 Gy Œ≥-ray irradiation. Expression of 14 lncRNAs and 17 mRNAs was found to be significantly down-regulated in the simulated microgravity condition. In contrast, irradiation up-regulated the expression of 55 lncRNAs and 56 mRNAs, while only one lncRNA, but no mRNA, was down-regulated. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs, 70 lncRNAs, and 87 mRNAs showed significantly altered expression under simulated microgravity after irradiation, and these changes were independently induced by irradiation and simulated microgravity. Together, our results indicate that simulated microgravity and irradiation additively and independently alter the expression of RNAs and their target genes in human lymphoblastoid cells.","Ionizing Radiation

OSD-546,SCD ‚Äì Stem Cell Differentiation Toward Osteoblast Onboard the International Space Station,Homo sapiens,Spaceflight Study,"Microgravity produces a variety of physical, chemical, and biological cues leading to an intricate and largely unresolved network of mechanosensitive molecules, transduction pathways, oxidative stress-related responses, and adaptations. The bone loss observed in astronauts and animal models after spaceflight is attributable to alterations in the bone tissue formation that depends on the continuous remodelling through the activities of bone-resorbing osteoclasts of hematopoietic lineage and bone-forming osteoblast of mesenchymal origin. Focusing on osteogenic differentiation, we present the results of the ‚ÄùSCD - Stem Cells Differentiation‚Äù experiment, aiming to determine how human bone marrow stem cells (hBMSCs) react to a prolonged (approx. 2 weeks) exposure to microgravity in terms of growth, and differentiation when treated with a physiological osteo-inducer as 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (Vit D3). The experiment was selected by the European Space Agency and transferred to ISS with the Soyuz-TMA- 16M (ISS 42S). It was carefully prepared because experiments performed on ISS remain a uniquely exceptional means of clarifying the microgravitational effects on osteogenesis, often only partially activated and detectable under simulated conditions. Because of the substantial reduction in calcification observed (about 50% inflight vs. on-ground control), we looked at significantly affected pathways in hBMSCs grown in microgravity vs. on-ground controls. Genome-wide expression changes were assessed via microarray and next generation sequencing (NGS) and integrated with exosomal mi-RNA measurements. Multi-scale pathway analysis of the omics datasets revealed evidence of cell cycle arrest, occurring with a number of osteogenic gene markers, but without indications of adipogenesis, senescence and/or apoptosis.","Spaceflight

OSD-547,Whole gene expression data from osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 under large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF),Mus musculus,Ground Study,"The diamagnetic levitation as a novel ground-based model for simulating a reduced gravity environment has recently been applied in life science research. In this study a specially designed superconducting magnet with a large gradient high magnetic field (LG-HMF), which can provide three apparent gravity levels (Œº-g, 1-g, and 2-g), was used to simulate a space-like gravity environment. Osteocyte, as the most important mechanosensor in bone, takes a pivotal position in mediating the mechano-induced bone remodeling. In this study, the effects of LG-HMF on gene expression profiling of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 were investigated by Affymetrix DNA microarray. LG-HMF affected osteocyte gene expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and data mining were further analyzed by using bioinfomatic tools, such as DAVID, iReport. 12 energy metabolism related genes (PFKL, AK4, ALDOC, COX7A1, STC1, ADM, CA9, CA12, P4HA1, APLN, GPR35 and GPR84) were further confirmed by real-time PCR. An integrated gene interaction network of 12 DEGs was constructed. Bio-data mining showed that genes involved in glucose metabolic process and apoptosis changed notablly. Our results demostrated that LG-HMF affected the expression of energy metabolism related genes in osteocyte.

OSD-554,"Characterization of Biofilm Formation, Growth, and Gene Expression on Different Materials and Environmental Conditions in Microgravity (Gene expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms)",Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Spaceflight Study,"Microorganisms' natural ability to live as organized multicellular communities ‚Äì also known as biofilms ‚Äì provides them with unique survival advantages. For instance, biofilms are protected against environmental stresses thanks to their extracellular matrix, which could contribute to persistent infections after treatment. Biofilms are also capable of strongly attaching to surfaces, where their metabolism byproducts could lead to surface material degradation. Furthermore, microgravity can alter biofilm behavior in unexpected ways, making the presence of biofilms in space a risk for both astronauts and spaceflight hardware. Despite the efforts to eliminate microorganism contamination from spacecrafts surfaces, it is impossible to prevent human-associated bacteria or fungus from eventually establishing biofilm surface colonization. Nevertheless, by understanding the changes that biofilms undergo in microgravity, it is possible to identify key differences and pathways that could be targeted to significantly reduce biofilm formation. The Space Biofilms project, performed at the International Space Station, contributes to such understanding by characterizing the morphology and gene expression of bacterial and fungal biofilms formed in microgravity with respect to ground controls. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was used as model organism for the bacterial morphology and transcriptomic studies, while Penicillium rubens was used for the fungal morphology study. Bacterial biofilm formation was characterized at one, two, and three days of incubation (37¬∞C) over six different materials: stainless steel 316, passivated stainless steel 316, a lubricant impregnated surface (LIS), catheter grade silicone with and without a linear microtopography, and cellulose membrane.","Growth Environment

The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/‚àí4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.

Here, we discuss a method utilizing KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs) to both carry biology to suborbital space as well as fix that biology at certain stages of flight. Plants on support media were inserted into the sample side of KFTs preloaded with RNAlater in the fixation chamber. The KFTs were activated at various stages of a simulated flight to fix the plants. RNA-seq analysis conducted on tissue samples housed in KFTs, showed that plants behaved consistently in KFTs when compared to petri-plates. Over the time course, roots adjusted to hypoxia and leaves adjusted to changes in photosynthesis. These responses were due in part to the environment imposed by the encased triple containment of the KFTs, which is a requirement for flight in human spacecraft. While plants exhibited expected reproducible transcriptomic alteration over time in the KFTs, responses to clinorotation during the simulated flight suggest that transcriptomic responses to suborbital spaceflight can be examined using this approach.","Treatment

The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017.

IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4‚Äì19.3 mmHg vs 16.3‚Äì20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals.

The International Space Exploration Coordination Group has set a roadmap whose long-range strategy envisions the expansion of human presence in the solar system to progress with exploration and knowledge and to accelerate innovation. Crewed missions to Mars could be envisaged by 2040. In this scenario, finding ways to use the local resources for the provision of food, construction materials, propellants, pharmaceuticals is needed. Plants are important resources for deep space manned missions because they produce phytochemicals of pharmaceutical relevance, are sources of food and provide oxygen which is crucial in bioregenerative life support systems. Growth analysis and plant biomass yield have been previously evaluated on Martian regolith simulants; however, molecular approaches employing gene expression analysis and proteomics are still missing. The present work aims at filling this gap by providing molecular data on a representative member of the Poaceae, Lolium multiflorum Lam., grown on potting soil and a Martian regolith simulant (MMS-1). The molecular data were complemented with optical microscopy of root/leaf tissues and physico-chemical analyses. The results show that the plants grew for 2 weeks on regolith simulants. The leaves were bent downwards and chlorotic, the roots developed a lacunar aerenchyma and small brownish deposits containing Fe were observed. Gene expression analysis and proteomics revealed changes in transcripts related to the phenylpropanoid pathway, stress response, primary metabolism and proteins involved in translation and DNA methylation. Additionally, the growth of plants slightly but significantly modified the pH of the regolith simulants. The results here presented constitute a useful resource to get a comprehensive understanding of the major factors impacting the growth of plants on MMS-1.","soil environment exposure

OSD-583,Characterization of mouse ocular responses (intraocular pressure) to a 35-day (RR-9) spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1 g on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38 +/‚àí 4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and remeasured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4‚Äì19.3 mmHg vs 16.3‚Äì20.3 mmHg) (p less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p less than 0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.

OSD-590,First transcriptome profiling of D. melanogaster after development in a deep underground low radiation background laboratory,Drosophila melanogaster,Ground Study,"Natural background radiation is a permanent multicomponent factor. It has an influence on biological organisms, but effects of its deprivation still remain unclear. The aim of our work was to study for the first time responses of D. melanogaster to conditions of the Deep Underground Low-Background Laboratory DULB-4900 (BNO, INR, RAS, Russia) at the transcriptome level by RNA-seq profiling. Overall 77 transcripts demonstrated differential abundance between flies exposed to low and natural background radiation. Enriched biological process functional categories were established for all genes with differential expression. The results showed down-regulation of primary metabolic processes and up-regulation of both the immune system process and the response to stimuli. The comparative analysis of our data and publicly available transcriptome data on D. melanogaster exposed to low and high doses of ionizing radiation did not reveal common DEGs in them. We hypothesize that the observed changes in gene expression can be explained by the influence of the underground conditions in DULB-4900, in particular, by the lack of stimuli. Thus, our study challenges the validity of the LNT model for the region of background radiation doses below a certain level (~16.4 nGy h-1) and the presence of a dose threshold for D. melanogaster.","Ionizing Radiation

Because there is concern about the adverse effects of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, this study assessed cardiac function and structure and immune cell infiltration in a mouse model of charged particle irradiation. Materials and methods: Male C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to oxygen ions (16O, 600 MeV/n at 0.25 to 0.26 Gy/min to a total dose of 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, or 1 Gy), protons (150 MeV, 0.35 to 0.55 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, or 1 Gy), or protons (150 MeV, 0.5 Gy) followed by 16O (600 MeV/n, 0.1 Gy). Separate groups of mice received 137Cs Œ≥ rays (1 Gy/min to 0, 0.5, 1, or 3 Gy) as a reference. Cardiac function and blood velocity were measured with ultrasonography at 3, 5, 7, and 9 months after irradiation. At 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months, cardiac tissue was collected to assess apoptosis, tissue remodeling, and markers of immune cells. Results: Ejection fraction and fractional shortening decreased at 3 and 7 months after 16O. These parameters did not change in mice exposed to Œ≥ rays, protons, or protons followed by 16O. Each of the radiation exposures caused only small increases in cleaved caspase3 and numbers of apoptotic nuclei. Changes in the levels of Œ± smooth muscle cell actin and a 75kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle suggested tissue remodeling, but there was no significant change in total collagen deposition at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months. Increases in protein amounts of cluster of differentiation (CD)2, CD68, and CD45 as measured with immunoblots at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or 16O alone suggested immune cell infiltration. For type III collagen, CD2 and CD68, the efficacy in inducing protein abundance of CD2, CD68, and CD45 was 16O greater than protons was greater than Œ≥ rays greater than protons followed by 16O. Conclusions: Low dose, high energy charged particle irradiation caused mild changes in cardiac function and tissue remodeling in the mouse. This dataset derives result from the western blot, histology, and immunohistochemistry assays.","Ionizing Radiation

Additionally, progressive neuronal loss and a glial phenotype in SF1g and SFŒºg brains, with pronounced phenotypes in SFŒºg, are seen upon acclimation to Earth conditions.

OSD-594,Advancing the automation of plant nucleic acid extraction for rapid diagnosis of plant diseases in space,Microbiota,Ground Study,"Human space exploration missions will continue the development of sustainable plant cultivation in what are obviously novel habitat settings. Effective pathology mitigation strategies are needed to cope with plant disease outbreaks in any space-based plant growth system. However, few technologies currently exist for space-based diagnosis of plant pathogens. Therefore, we developed a method of extracting plant nucleic acid that will facilitate the rapid diagnosis of plant diseases for future spaceflight applications. The microHomogenizer from Claremont BioSolutions, originally designed for bacterial and animal tissue samples, was evaluated for plant‚Äìmicrobial nucleic acid extractions. The microHomogenizer is an appealing device in that it provides automation and containment capabilities that would be required in spaceflight applications. Two different plant pathosystems were used to assess the versatility of the extraction process. Tomato and lettuce plants were respectively inoculated with a fungal plant pathogen, an oomycete pathogen, and a plant viral pathogen. The microHomogenizer, along with the developed protocols, proved to be an effective mechanism for producing DNA from two pathosystems, in that PCR and sequencing of the resulting samples demonstrated clear DNA-based diagnoses. Thus, this investigation advances the efforts to automate nucleic acid extraction for future plant disease diagnosis in space.","Organism Part

Multiple organ systems are affected by microgravity and radiation, including the cardiovascular system. Previous transcriptomic studies have sought to reveal the changes in gene expression after spaceflight. However, little is known about the impact of long-term spaceflight on the mouse heart in vivo. This study focuses on the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female C57BL/6J mice flown on the International Space Station (ISS) for 30 days. RNA was isolated from the hearts of three flight and three comparable ground control mice and RNA sequencing was performed. Our analyses showed that 1147 transcripts were significantly regulated after spaceflight. The MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling pathways were predicted to be activated. Transcripts related to cytoskeleton breakdown and organization were upregulated, but no significant change in the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) components or oxidative stress pathway-associated transcripts occurred. Our results indicate an absence of cellular senescence, and a significant upregulation of transcripts associated with the cell cycle. Transcripts related to cellular maintenance and survival were most affected by spaceflight, suggesting that cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,NG-11,Rodent Flight Hardware (Transporter and Habitat),10.26030/ev5t-0604
OSD-608,Dose-dependent skeletal deficits due to varied reductions in mechanical loading in rats (Tibia - pQCT),Rattus norvegicus,Ground Study,"Reduced skeletal loading leads to marked bone loss. Animal models of hindlimb suspension are widely used to assess alterations in skeleton during the course of complete unloading. More recently, the effects of partial unloading on the musculoskeletal system have been interrogated in mice and rats, revealing dose-dependent effects of partial weight bearing (PWB) on the skeleton and skeletal muscle. Here, we extended these studies to determine the structural and functional skeletal alterations in 14-week-old male Wister rats exposed to 20%, 40%, 70%, or 100% of body weight for 1, 2, or 4 weeks (n‚Äâ equals 11‚Äì12/group). Using in vivo pQCT, we found that trabecular bone density at the proximal tibia declined in proportion to the degree of unloading and continued progressively with time, without evidence of a plateau by 4 weeks. Ex vivo measurements of trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femur by microcomputed tomography revealed deficits in bone volume fraction, 2 and 4 weeks after unloading. Histologic analyses of trabecular bone in the distal femur revealed the decreased osteoblast number and mineralizing surface in unloaded rats. Three-point bending of the femoral diaphysis indicated modest or no reductions in femoral stiffness and estimated modulus due to PWB. Our results suggest that this rat model of PWB leads to trabecular bone deterioration that is progressive and generally proportional to the degree of PWB, with minimal effects on cortical bone. This study derives results from the pQCT assay using tibia tissue.","Partial Weight Bearing

To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‚Äêmonth‚Äêold female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers.

The ground control was conducted on a 14-day delay, and was harvested on July 3, 2002. During this period there were a total of 7 harvests of PESTO wheat and priming of 6 wheat root modules on orbit. A total of 18 plants were fixed on orbit for morphological and structural analysis, 4 plants were fixed for RNA and molecular genetic analysis and greater than 150 plants were frozen for biochemical analysis. A total of 3018 images of wheat chambers were collected from the BPS cameras during flight, and 3,640 images were obtained from the ground controls. A total of 65 digital images of the wheat harvest were collected during flight, with 75 being collected from ground controls. In addition, crew members recorded approximately 50 images and over 3 hrs of video of flight operations. Over 2 gigabytes of environmental data were obtained from the flight and ground control units. A ground control experiment was conducted in the BPS ground control chamber in the Orbiter Environment Simulator (OES) at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Site Support Facility in Hangar L. The ground control was delayed by 14-days from the real- time flight operations in order to duplicate the flight operations as closely as possible in a 1 g environment.

The experiment examined the operationalization of Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) as a generalizable approach to preserving biology at various phases of suborbital flight. The biology chosen for this experiment was Arabidopsis thaliana, ecotype Col-0, because of the plant‚Äôs history of spaceflight experimentation within KFTs and wealth of comparative data from orbital experiments. KFTs were deployed as a wearable device, a leg pouch attached to the astronaut, which proved to be operationally effective during the course of the flight. Data from the inflight samples indicated that the microgravity period of the flight elicited the strongest transcriptomic responses as measured by the number of genes showing differential expression. Genes related to reactive oxygen species and stress, as well as genes associated with orbital spaceflight, were highly represented among the suborbital gene expression profile. In addition, gene families largely unaffected in orbital spaceflight were diversely regulated in suborbital flight, including stress-responsive transcription factors. The human-tended suborbital experiment demonstrated the operational effectiveness of the KFTs in suborbital flight and suggests that rapid transcriptomic responses are a part of the temporal dynamics at the beginning of physiological adaptation to spaceflight.","Time

OSD-635,Spaceflight effects on human vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype and function,Homo sapiens,Spaceflight Study,"The cardiovascular system is strongly impacted by the hazards of spaceflight. Astronauts spending steadily increasing lengths of time in microgravity are subject to cardiovascular deconditioning resulting in loss of vascular tone, reduced total blood volume, and diminished cardiac output. Appreciating the mechanisms by which the cells of the vasculature are altered during spaceflight will be integral to understanding and combating these deleterious effects as the human presence in space advances. In this study, we performed RNA-Seq analysis coupled with review by QIAGEN Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software on human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) cultured for 3 days in microgravity and aboard the International Space Station to assess the transcriptomic changes that occur during spaceflight. The results of our RNA-Seq analysis show that SMCs undergo a wide range of transcriptional alteration while in space, significantly affecting 4,422 genes. SMCs largely down-regulate markers of the contractile, synthetic, and osteogenic phenotypes including smooth muscle alpha actin (Œ±SMA), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs). Additionally, components of several cellular signaling pathways were strongly impacted including the STAT3, NFŒ∫B, PI3K/AKT, HIF1Œ±, and Endothelin pathways. This study highlights the significant changes in transcriptional behavior SMCs exhibit during spaceflight and puts these changes in context to better understand vascular function in space.",Spaceflight,transcription profiling,SpaceX-17,Kayser experimental unit (KEU-RO),10.26030/8n5a-q187
OSD-640,Combined space stressors induce independent behavioral deficits predicted by early peripheral blood monocytes (flow cytometry),Mus musculus,Ground Study,"Interplanetary space travel poses many hazards to the human body. To protect astronaut health and performance on critical missions, there is first a need to understand the effects of deep space hazards, including ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity. Previous studies of rodents exposed to a single such stressor document significant deficits, but our study is the first to investigate possible cumulative and synergistic impacts of simultaneous ionizing radiation, confinement, and altered gravity on behavior and cognition. Our cohort was divided between 6‚Äêmonth‚Äêold female and male mice in group, social isolation, or hindlimb unloading housing, exposed to 0 or 50 cGy of 5 ion simplified simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCRsim). We report interactions and independent effects of GCRsim exposure and housing conditions on behavioral and cognitive performance. Exposure to GCRsim drove changes in immune cell populations in peripheral blood collected early after irradiation, while housing conditions drove changes in blood collected at a later point. Female mice were largely resilient to deficits observed in male mice. Finally, we used principal component analysis to represent total deficits as principal component scores, which were predicted by general linear models using GCR exposure, housing condition, and early blood biomarkers. This dataset derives results from the flow cytometry assay using blood samples from same source animals used for behavioral studies in OSD-618.","Hindlimb Unloading

OSD-652,Influence of gonadectomy on muscle health in micro- and partial-gravity environments in rats (Grip; force transducer),Rattus norvegicus,Ground Study,"Gonadal hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol, modulate muscle size and strength in males and females. However, the influence of sex hormones on muscle strength in micro- and partial-gravity environments (e.g., the Moon or Mars) is not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of gonadectomy (castration/ovariectomy) on progression of muscle atrophy in both micro- and partial-gravity environments in male and female rats. Male and female Fischer rats (n equals 120) underwent castration/ovariectomy (CAST/OVX) or sham surgery (SHAM) at 11 weeks of age. After 2 weeks of recovery, rats were exposed to hindlimb unloading (0g), partial weight bearing at 40% of normal loading (0.4g, Martian gravity), or normal loading (1.0g) for 28 days. In males, CAST did not exacerbate body weight loss or other metrics of musculoskeletal health. In females, OVX animals tended to have greater body weight loss and greater gastrocnemius loss. Within 7 days of exposure to either microgravity or partial gravity, females had detectable changes to estrous cycle, with greater time spent in low-estradiol phases diestrus and metestrus (‚àº47% in 1g vs. 58% in 0g and 72% in 0.4g animals, P equals 0.005). We conclude that in males testosterone deficiency at the initiation of unloading has little effect on the trajectory of muscle loss. In females, initial low estradiol status may result in greater musculoskeletal losses. This study derives results from Grip (Force Transducer).","Time

OSD-654,"Toward countering muscle and bone loss with spaceflight: GSK3 as a potential target (Tibia, RR9 and HLU, MicroCT and DXA Scanning)",Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"We examined the effects of ~30 days of spaceflight on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) content and inhibitory serine phosphorylation in murine muscle and bone samples from four separate missions (BION-M1, Rodent Research missions RR1, RR9, and RR18). Spaceflight reduced GSK3b content across all missions, whereas its serine phosphorylation was elevated with RR18 and BION-M1. The reduction in GSK3b was linked to the reduction in type IIA fibers commonly observed with spaceflight as these fibers are particularly enriched with GSK3. We then tested the effects of inhibiting GSK3 before this fiber type shift, and we demonstrate that muscle-specific Gsk3 knockdown increased muscle mass, preserved muscle strength, and promoted the oxidative fiber type with Earth-based hindlimb unloading. In bone, GSK3 activation was enhanced after spaceflight; and strikingly, muscle-specific Gsk3 deletion increased bone mineral density in response to hindlimb unloading. Thus, future studies should test the effects of GSK3 inhibition during spaceflight. This study derives results from the DXA and micro computed tomography assays using tibia tissue from the RR9 mission and hindlimb unloaded/suspended (HLU/HLS) animals.

The simulated GCR irradiation was carried out in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). The exposures were conducted acutely for two dose points at 40 cGy or 80 cGy, with sequential delivery of proton, helium, oxygen, silicon, and iron ions. Control and irradiated seedlings were then harvested and stabilized in RNAlater at 3 hrs. post irradiation. Total RNA was isolated for transcriptomic analyses using RNAseq. The data revealed that the transcriptomic responses were dose-dependent, with significant upregulation of DNA repair pathways and downregulation of glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. Glucosinolates are important for plant pathogen defense and for the taste of a plant, which are both relevant to growing plants for spaceflight. These findings fill in knowledge gaps of how plants respond to radiation in beyond-Earth environments.","Ionizing Radiation

Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts shares similar physiological changes to muscle wasting in older adults, known as sarcopenia. These shared attributes provide a rationale for investigating molecular changes in muscle cells exposed to spaceflight that may mimic the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We report the results from three-dimensional myobundles derived from muscle biopsies from young and older adults, integrated into an autonomous CubeLab‚Ñ¢, and flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX CRS-21 as part of the NIH/NASA funded Tissue Chips in Space program. Global transcriptomic RNA-Seq analyses comparing the myobundles in space and on the ground revealed downregulation of shared transcripts related to myoblast proliferation and muscle differentiation. The analyses also revealed downregulated differentially expressed gene pathways related to muscle metabolism unique to myobundles derived from the older cohort exposed to the space environment compared to ground controls. Gene classes related to inflammatory pathways were downregulated in flight samples cultured from the younger cohort compared to ground controls. Our muscle tissue chip platform provides an approach to studying the cell autonomous effects of spaceflight on muscle cell biology that may not be appreciated on the whole organ or organism level and sets the stage for continued data collection from muscle tissue chip experimentation in microgravity.

We examined the roles of anti-oxidative sulfur-containing compounds on hepatic damage after spaceflight. We analyzed the livers of mice on board the International Space Station for 30¬†days. During spaceflight, half of the mice were exposed to artificial earth gravity (1¬†g) using centrifugation cages. Sulfur-metabolomics of the livers of mice after spaceflight revealed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants (ergothioneine, glutathione, cysteine, taurine, thiamine, etc.) and their intermediates (cysteine sulfonic acid, hercynine, N-acethylserine, serine, etc.) compared to the controls on the ground. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing showed upregulation of gene sets related to oxidative stress and sulfur metabolism, and downregulation of gene sets related to glutathione reducibility in the livers of mice after spaceflight, compared to controls on the ground. These changes were partially mitigated by exposure to 1¬†g centrifugation. For the first time, we observed a decrease in sulfur antioxidants based on a comprehensive analysis of the livers of mice after spaceflight. Our data suggest that a decrease in sulfur-containing compounds owing to both microgravity and other spaceflight environments (radiation and stressors) contributes to liver damage after spaceflight.","Spaceflight

OSD-690,Nrf2 alleviates spaceflight-induced immunosuppression and thrombotic microangiopathy in mice,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Spaceflight-related stresses impact health via various body systems, including the haematopoietic and immune systems, with effects ranging from moderate alterations of homoeostasis to serious illness. Oxidative stress appears to be involved in these changes, and the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates expression of a set of cytoprotective and antioxidative stress response genes, has been implicated in the response to spaceflight-induced stresses. Here, we show through analyses of mice from the MHU-3 project, in which Nrf2-knockout mice travelled in space for 31 days, that mice lacking Nrf2 suffer more seriously from spaceflight-induced immunosuppression than wild-type mice. We discovered that a one-month spaceflight-triggered the expression of tissue inflammatory marker genes in wild-type mice, an effect that was even more pronounced in the absence of Nrf2. Concomitant with induction of inflammatory conditions, the consumption of coagulation-fibrinolytic factors and platelets was elevated by spaceflight and further accelerated by Nrf2 deficiency. These results highlight that Nrf2 mitigates spaceflight-induced inflammation, subsequent immunosuppression, and thrombotic microangiopathy. These observations reveal a new strategy to relieve health problems encountered during spaceflight.","Spaceflight

OSD-691,"Spaceflight increases sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak and this cannot be counteracted with BuOE treatment (Soleus muscle from RR-18, Western Blot and ATPase Assays)",Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"Spending time in a microgravity environment is known to cause significant skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness via muscle unloading, which can be partly attributed to Ca2+ dysregulation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump is responsible for bringing Ca2+ from the cytosol into its storage site, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), at the expense of ATP. We have recently demonstrated that, in the soleus of spaceflown mice, the Ca2+ uptake ability of the SERCA pump is severely impaired and this may be attributed to increases in reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS), to which SERCA is highly susceptible. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate whether treatment with the antioxidant, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP (BuOE), could attenuate muscle atrophy and SERCA dysfunction. We received soleus muscles from the rodent research 18 mission which had male mice housed on the international space station for 35 days and treated with either saline or BuOE. Spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and significantly increased SERCA‚Äôs ionophore ratio, a measure of SR Ca2+ leak, and 4-HNE content (marker of RONS), none of which could be rescued by BuOE treatment. In conclusion, we find that spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak that cannot be counteracted with antioxidant treatment. Future work should investigate alternative therapeutics that are specifically aimed at increasing SERCA activation or reducing Ca2+ leak. This study derives results from the Western Blot and ATPase Assays using soleus tissue from the RR-18 mission.","Spaceflight

OSD-698,Spaceflight-Induced Gene Expression Profiles in the Mouse Brain Are Attenuated by Treatment with the Antioxidant BuOE - Frontal Cortex,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"The demands of deep space pose a health risk to the central nervous system that has long been a concern when sending humans to space. While little is known about how spaceflight affects transcription spatially in the brain, a greater understanding of this process has the potential to aid strategies that mitigate the effects of spaceflight on the brain. Therefore, we performed GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling of mouse brains subjected to either spaceflight or grounded controls. Four brain regions were selected: Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Corunu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus. Antioxidants have emerged as a potential means of attenuating the effects of spaceflight, so we treated a subset of the mice with a superoxide dismutase mimic, MnTnBuOE-2-PyP 5+ (BuOE). Our analysis revealed hundreds of differentially expressed genes due to spaceflight in each of the four brain regions. Both common and region-specific transcriptomic responses were observed. Metabolic pathways and pathways sensitive to oxidative stress were enriched in the four brain regions due to spaceflight. These findings enhance our understanding of brain regional variation in susceptibility to spaceflight conditions. BuOE reduced the transcriptomic effects of spaceflight at a large number of genes, suggesting that this compound may attenuate oxidative stress-induced brain damage caused by the spaceflight environment. This study contains data of frontal cortex region. The data of other brain regions are deposited in OSD-682 (cornu ammonis 1), OSD-685 (dentate gyrus), and OSD-699 (cerebral cortex).","Spaceflight

OSD-715,Characterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations - Proteomics data,Mus musculus,Spaceflight Study,"The health risks associated with spaceflight-induced ocular structural and functional damage has become a recent concern for NASA. The goal of the present study was to characterize the effects of spaceflight and reentry to 1‚Äâg on the structure and integrity of the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) in the eye. To investigate possible mechanisms, changes in protein expression profiles were examined in mouse ocular tissue after spaceflight. Ten week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on Space-X 12 at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August, 2017. After a 35-day mission, mice were returned to Earth alive. Within 38‚Äâ+/-‚Äâ4 hours of splashdown, mice were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected for analysis. Ground control (GC) and vivarium control mice were maintained on Earth in flight hardware or normal vivarium cages respectively. Repeated intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements were performed before the flight launch and re-measured before the mice were euthanized after splashdown. IOP was significantly lower in post-flight measurements compared to that of pre-flight (14.4-19.3‚ÄâmmHg vs 16.3-20.3‚ÄâmmHg) (p‚Äâ less than 0.05) for the left eye. Flight group had significant apoptosis in the retina and retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups (p‚Äâ less than ‚Äâ0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis of the retina revealed that an increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) in the flight mice compared to controls gave strong indication of disturbance of BRB integrity. There were also a significant increase in the expression of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and a decrease in the expression of the BRB-related tight junction protein, Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Proteomic analysis showed that many key proteins and pathways responsible for cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function and metabolic stress were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to ground control animals. These data indicate a complex cellular response that may alter retina structure and BRB integrity following long-term spaceflight.",Spaceflight,protein expression profiling,SpaceX-12,Rodent Habitat,10.26030/0y6s-2005
