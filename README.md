# OSDR-Chatbot-Widget

## Project Overview
This project integrates scientific research data from NASA's Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) into a Milvus vector database for efficient storage and retrieval. The project also includes a chatbot that uses the vector database to answer queries related to spaceflight studies and other scientific experiments stored in OSDR.
